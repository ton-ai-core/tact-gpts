By the end of the year, we will have at least a practical compiler and one another useful tool, which we are research right now.

Text: Hey everyone, a short status update on Tact.

Tact as an improved FunC

Today Tact is a working language that compiles to FunC and offers a number of features that help writing TON contracts with considerably less boilerplate. Big kudos to @cmxog and @p0lunin for pulling this off and getting us to that point.

Tact compiler supports some basic features: control flow and operators, and adds to FunC with nice definitions for structs and enums, automatic de/serialization to/from cells and offers a working model for generic types that lets implementing safe APIs such as checking signed message and extracting its body in one call.

You can check out how Wallet V3 code looks like in Tact right now: 
https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/examples/wallet_v3.tact

At this stage Tact still has some oddities and boilerplate that is easy to fix within the current model: e.g. adding mutable slices will let us cleanup annoying "trailing" slices, and we can bake in the serialization compatible with TL-B to remove unnecessary "derive impl (De)serialize" calls. But these are just small polishing tasks that we will put aside for a minute and look at the bigger picture.

The road ahead: from ‚ÄúRust‚Äù to ‚ÄúSwift‚Äù

Let's draw some parallels with popular systems programming languages: C, Rust and Swift. 

FunC is, well, "fun C" :-), a thin abstraction over underlying machine with a much nicer syntax than an assembly language. 

Current Tact is somewhat similar to Rust: it has a more expressive and safer type system, plus some syntactic affordances, yet delegating a lot of choices to the user and having some annoying internal details sticking out whether you need them or not.

What we want to achieve is a leap-frog language that focuses on the developer experience and makes writing most contracts significantly easier than FunC and the current Tact, thus making development on TON much more accessible to new enthusiasts who join the community today and in the future. 

At the risk of making a bad analogy, I will refer to Swift: this is a language that tries to combine two opposites ‚Äî being capable to express the finest details of the program with minimal overhead, while also being instantly friendly to newcomers and making basic programs look as simple as a scripting language.

Intermission

Before we go ahead improving tiny bits of the language that we've got, we are taking a brief pause to review our original goals and design a more concise and powerful syntax. And then improve the compiler towards that goal.

We want to add to the language:

1. Dedicated first-class syntax for message handlers and message interfaces.
2. No-boilerplate serialization compatible with TL-B.
3. Fully automated load/store for the contract state.
4. Gas/value requirements in the interfaces.

We will rewrite common contracts in hypothetical Tact 1.1 and then come back with a concrete roadmap on how we build towards that.

It's a good point. I risk looking a little foolish here. Is there any way we could have something like auto-generated abi later? 

So we could parse methods and run them using UI in an external software like an online IDE for newcomers using Tact (like RemixIDE analog).

I am actually started to work on reinstanting TACT compiler and bult it from scratch, i am currently ironing out some corner cases, waiting for FunC compiler fixes, but i was able to compile walet-v4-like contract that even works better (less gas usage) than native implementation.

+ write materials in the "thinking in TON" paradigm:

It is very hard to write contracts for ton IF you are trying to use your experience from other blockchains. And it is quite easy once you got into distributed thinking

Text: My initial impression of this new compiler was remarkable. I recently tested distributed betting contract. It was so easy to build comparing to nominator's pool that not even distributed. Ability to automatically extract ABI, build interfaces list, clean and a safe way to build contracts is remarkable comparing to func. 

I don't see the reason to even try to continue to push func tools for general audience since it is just awful (and reason why we don't have much apps in ton still), compiler have some issues, but they are on par with func level.

in the approach where the contract declares on the sources itself, there‚Äôs no other authority to verify that when publishing the ipfs link, which obviously can be forged.

so yes, the contracts can be re-verified, but would we want explorers displaying the source code and encouraging all users to re-verify all the time?

with verifiers, there‚Äôs a gatekeeper. that gatekeeper would need to be compromised in order to publish a fake proof.

Text: I just declared a mapping with a struct in my code, and set the data into it! 

All the transactions ran successfully when I wrote the data into the chain.

But when I read the contract message, I got this kind of data set. As you can see, it should be based on a key input that is an Int. I get null when I input a key that is not an Int.

So when I printed all the mapping data, I got this. 

My question is, how can we read the mapping data from the smart contract successfully? Because I need to transform/decode the bits into an Int or?

I am thinking that how I can set series of functions once user send numbers, like '1, 2, 3, 4.....`

If receive integer number 1, I store his address.
if else receive the integer number 2, I store his TON balance..during the moment.

If you get Exit Code 7 all the time since your ContractA will initialized a ContractB. It might be happend because you didn't set a default value for the dataType you claimed firstly!!

(Took hours to find the bug üò≠
Reply to: Same issue: If you deploy a contract that can trigger the deployment of a new contract, you need to ensure that the initial parameters you specify have default values. In Rust, you must provide a default value for any Int or Address you set previously.

This is why we got Exit Code: 7

To be clear, fwd_fee is the fee that we paid during the execution. 

And forward_ton_amount or forward_amount in TEP62 is the nano-ton that we move to token contract itself to paid with the future storage cost, is that correct?

(aka, the get method for 'get_nft_data') 

1/ I can called and get my nft contract data back successfully. 

2/ Some people asked that I should change the Get Function name to exactly same in get_nft_data. But I don't think it would work.

We only accept with Cell data type.

Text: No, collection and each NFT of collection have it's own independent content.
However content of the NFT is not stored in it's contract but distributed between NFT and Collection. To get finalised NFT content you need to get individual_content from NFT contract and process it via collection's get_nft_content method. Such separation allows to build flexible systems, for instance
- collection can contain shared part of content of all items
- update of collection contract allows to update all NFT's content simultaneously by updating get_nft_content function (otherwise it would be necessary to update each NFT separately)

I have the contract logic that will trigge like this. I am thinking that how I can set in 'value' field, to make sure the Tx will not failed? (Or any Mode I should set in Send function with parameters)

Because when I tried this at this moment, my contract will get Auction Failed.

Text: Hello, TON developers!üëã
Ready to step into the 2023 TON massive adoption year? Let‚Äôs do it with Tact!

TLDR

Tact is a high-level, scalable language designed to improve the usability of smart contract development for TON. If you've long wanted to dive into smart contract development, now is the time when you can start from the very basics as a Tact developer. Definitely, your participation will be especially appreciated if you are an experienced FunC developerü§ù.

The Tact language project was originally initiated in the summer of 2022 when the original concept was designed. 
In December 2022, the Tact compiler development continued, and currently work is in full swing.üåã


What next?

To improve the quality of the Tact compiler an important requestü•∫  to the great TON community is to play with the compiler according to the template project.  
If you will find a BIG problem with the Tact compiler itself, we will be very happy if you tell us about it in the chat or in git issues. Also, feel free to ask your questions Tact questions in chat. 

If you have any questions about the Tact documentation DM me @iftryalexg  - I will disclose all questions ASAP in the documentation or answer you with a link that helps you.ü§ì

Reply to: Hi, I followed the document that put the cell data I store in contract put as 'StringBuilder'. 

But since I append the String, got this error. 

` cannot unify type tuple with slice

Text: TACT reached feature and ABI freeze in 0.8.1

This is the last breaking release before 1.0.0. I expect compiler to have some possible bugs, but if you are testing your contracts you should be fine. I recommend it to early-stage production development. For example if you are going to release in a month-two, TACT is a good choise for you.

Changes:
* Dictionaries in typescript bindings
* You can now generate bindings for non-tact contracts by writing a specially formatted JSON file (we are welcome to contribute another ways to describe contracts!)
* Stable and predictable ABI that you can use in your explorers and apps to generate a UI for working with a smart contract

Text: About some standard libraries:

1. since simpleSend converted to nativeSendMessage, it seems doesn't support with contract in default yet.


2. For reply() method call: what can we leverage in this for the bounced message about body? 

I mean if the body informations will bounced back, can we design a receive method to catch this error then do other behavior? (let's say ContractA -> Contract B (bounces the message) -> Contract A (catch the message) 

3. For the nativeReserve, there has only 3 usage in `Tact Example`, can we say that:
"If the mode is set to 0, the output action will reserve exactly the specified amount of nano-toncoins. If the mode is set to 2, the output action will reserve at most the specified amount of nano-toncoins. If the mode is set to 1 or 3, the output action will reserve all but the specified amount of nano-toncoins."

Text: I did a mistake in the description: we will send body to the sender who had sent a message to our contract(so dst of bounced message does not depends on the body).
So the message body will be according to what you placed there - comment or anything else.

About catching messages, as I understand if we want to do something special in the contract we need to specify our actions with opcodes. And something special, I mean some actions, that we will do after getting this. Technically we can define actions based on bounced messages, but it seems like bad behavior. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong here, everything I saw contracts just ignores bounced messages(recognized by flag). In my understanding bounce generally serves only for returning funds.

Maybe somebody knows an example, where we do some actions after bounced message gets?

It is possible that you mixed two concepts:
collection metadata (metadata of collection as a whole set), one per collection,
nft metadata - one per item.

Because "to maintain" a contract alive, we need keep some TON in it for storage cost? 


Then what is this the difference we just set a constant number like here in Jetton standard as well? 

    const minTonsForStorage: Int = ton("0.01");
Reply to: About some standard libraries:

1. since simpleSend converted to nativeSendMessage, it seems doesn't support with contract in default yet.


2. For reply() method call: what can we leverage in this for the bounced message about body? 

I mean if the body informations will bounced back, can we design a receive method to catch this error then do other behavior? (let's say ContractA -> Contract B (bounces the message) -> Contract A (catch the message) 

3. For the nativeReserve, there has only 3 usage in `Tact Example`, can we say that:
"If the mode is set to 0, the output action will reserve exactly the specified amount of nano-toncoins. If the mode is set to 2, the output action will reserve at most the specified amount of nano-toncoins. If the mode is set to 1 or 3, the output action will reserve all but the specified amount of nano-toncoins."

Text: I am still debugging which part of the initial code I pointed to the contract is causing issues.

There are still some type check errors. I think I may have triggered an edge case for Tact, as it is able to compile the code even with errors present.

Some errors will only show up with an Exit Code 7, while others don't.

Additionally, some errors cause the wrong address to be stored in the contract status.

Text: It sounds foolish, but it actually happened! I initially pointed the owner address to my wallet address when deploying the Collection contract, but for some reason, since I read the contract status, it stored the wrong wallet address (i.e. an unknown type of address).

After thinking for a while and testing for hours, I am assuming that even though I put the initial code, the TVM might have caught and stored the wrong address. It is beyond my understanding.

Text: Do not set the get function with a question mark, even though the NFT item address is predictable.

I think the question mark will cause the data set to take up more space in bits/cells, which may cause the original data you passed to the contract to be shifted.

For example, the owner_address we declared initially when deploying this collection contract.

Text: Hi @steve_kite , is this a proper way to send a series of addresses? I noticed that there is a concept in TVM called High-load wallets that we haven't implement in Tact I guess?
Reply to: Question: How we can multi-sending the transaction in Tact?

I mean it is based on Gas Cost right? Then I am trying like this: Building a Int => Address mapping list, and using do method to adding one my one to get receiver address.

But you know, it's unrealistic because the gas used is huge here. 

Anyone has better solution for this? Since we don't have array in Tact.

https://github.com/a16z/eth-testnet-drop

1/ In EVM, the gas cost is so high. So one of the solution is that we only store the merkle root to save the spaces we need on-chain.

2/ We don't have array in Tact, then how we can store a list that with Users Addresses' data? And search, calling it each by each?

Text: Sharing the code I tried to build for lottery for these two days:

1) It included the if... else if statment in practice.
2) It included some  do... until statment in practice.
3) It included the mapping in practice with set get
4) It included some "ABCDEFG".asComment()  in usage. 
5) It included the usage for randomInt()

I have identified that it is not efficient to send text messages and move the prize in the same transaction, as it is not predictable for the gas cost. I was using a constant number for it, but it seems that this is not a good approach.

Please note:
1) If you want to trigger two 'Send' methods in one 'Receive' method job, you should not add 'bounce: false'. The second 'Send' method will not be triggered if you do so.

2) The code still has many bugs and not perfect. Just sharing it for community.

Text: @ton-community/tx-emulator has been rebranded into @ton-community/sandbox and significantly improved!

It now uses the new ton-core under the hood and is compatible with all the APIs that it provides, making the creation of smart contract wrappers easier than ever!

More importantly though, the blockchain-experimental features have been merged, so you can now emulate whole chains of transactions and even emulate interactions with existing smart contracts from real networks (both mainnet and testnet)!

Together with it we released another package, test-utils, which, along with the new features  of sandbox, significantly simplifies testing of systems of multiple smart contracts.

Check out the examples provided together with sandbox to see the intended way to use it.

Please note that this tool is still in beta, but we would love to hear any feedback from you!

Also, stay tuned for more detailed tutorials for using this tool!

Text: Yes, I have more feedback on this. 

I am currently dealing with transferring multiple addresses in a single transaction. It can be difficult to predict the current balance that the Vault contract still has. 

This can make it challenging to work with, especially if we are dealing with a Staking or Vault contract that needs to calculate a fee share. 

I highly recommend that we include a syntax in the standard libraries that shows the balance of TON that a contract has (after the current message and subtracting storage fees, etc.).
Reply to: Balance includes value of incoming message and therefore always more than is available since it is before gas substraction

Because I tested in SendPayGasSeparately already, it seems not what I want neither what he mentioned there. 

Seems out of my knowledge or just Tact haven't implement yet.

Text: Actually from definition of SendParameters, 
it's not necessary to declare mode = 0:
struct SendParameters {
    bounce: Bool = true;
    to: Address;
    value: Int;
    mode: Int = 0;
    body: Cell? = null;
    code: Cell? = null;
    data: Cell? = null;
}

About your result, maybe need to create separate contract to check sending message with mode=0. I think it will work fine.

Reply to: is there any merkle root I can use to store User List? Like the example here?
https://github.com/a16z/eth-testnet-drop

1/ In EVM, the gas cost is so high. So one of the solution is that we only store the merkle root to save the spaces we need on-chain.

2/ We don't have array in Tact, then how we can store a list that with Users Addresses' data? And search, calling it each by each?


I am thinking to use the Collection+Item design like NFTs. Correct me if I am wrong. Thanks...

Text: What I mean is for the big project that will bind the call methods to create the new contract like NFT Collection -> NFT Item contract.


1/ [Red square] if I build the new It statement, the variable of owner will change in a new one. 

How to keep the single address as owner and keep the authority all the time.


2/ [Orange square] the first contract's "New" statement will pass the message to my UserRecord contract(the second one); I will need to keep the parameters and status to track contract 1&2's reactions. 

Since I will get the reply message from Contract 2 sending to contract 1. 

My question is, how can we track those series of messages trigged by this Tx?

ContractA: receive(A) ‚Äî calling to --> ContractB: receive(the A plus)  ‚Äî calling to ‚Äî> ContractA: receive("any feedback message") 


3/ How we fetch the balance of the contract all the time(like monitoring each Txs cost, and the remaining balance for an address)


Since I always tested in production test net, now I am facing the issue that the contract might fail ‚Äúat some times‚Äù but works successfully by chance. (Yes, the opCode is the same, but the result might be failed based on different sizes of TON) This is why I am researching how to write proper test cases.

Actual result: 


Error: Line 28, col 33:

  29 | 
Type "Builder" does not have a function named "storeSlice"


How it works instead:

let builder: Builder = beginCell();
builder = storeSlice(builder, msg);
let message: Cell = endCell(builder);


Is it expected behavior in case 1 or what I‚Äôm doing wrong? maybe it's a bug

e.g. msg.asCell() works as expected.

Reply to: But then your error code might not have occurred because the format of FunC files looks different. Maybe you need to debug by looking at your full .tact file first.

Text: But what is the idea? I'm using TON wallet for year and looked into transaction history a few times. Much more reason for me was that I tested wallets. And I believe, that most part of users just want to swipe off transaction's push notify(if it's not about the incoming huge amountsüëÄü§©) and almost never look at their transaction's history.

Please, note, that I have practical experience only in realizing smart contracts for learning purposes and never realized my own product for TON. 
From what I know about classic development, I see following ways:

1) To make own Web client(mobile/desktop). That will display your contract's with UI you want. Something like a blockchain explorer adapted to your contract and viewing that's content according to your idea.

2) To create something like(or exactly the same) NFT item. Users can see this on their wallets from blockchain explorers and some wallets. You can try to implement your updates via NFT-editable. 
For example, GetGem's Easter eggs event was implemented with NFT. I tested it, and I've never got any notifications in the blockchain. But I have a lot in the telegram bot or in their marketplace. Another thing is that I could open my wallet when I wanted and check the "status" of my egg.

That's what I meant, hope it looks more clear for now.

The only way I think possible is writing a for loop read each line of data in the mapping. But again, it is not reliable since the gas cost is not predictable, which means your Tx might failed in a sudden the bounced.

Text: Tact v0.9.0

This release is significantly improves gas usage and compatibility with func by allowing importing func files into your Tact contract!

This line would append contents of this file to the begining of Tact-generated file:

import "./native.fc";

Then you can declare native functions in tact that uses your func code.

Some caveats: func imports are not supported, order of imports are not guaranteed, func syntax is not verified (this could lead to cryptic errors), type safety is reduced and you have to be careful with declaring native functions in tact.

https://github.com/howardpen9/tact-nft-standard

- There are example URIs for the image content, so you can change it to whatever you need! It's an off-chain content following the TEP64 metadata.

- For the minting process, you need to know that the is_initialized field is defined when the contract is deployed. Once the Item is being minted, it should change to true. (TEP-62)

- The Royalties Fee part has also been successfully implemented following TEP-66; it is now set to a default of 35% in the deploy.ts file. You can change it to whatever you want.

Text: Maybe my thoughts will be helpful:

I saw two cases in general in FunC contracts:
1) Messages bounced back if it something not expected by contract with funds - fees value. It's good practice and user friendly.
2) Messages just deliver to the destination contract, and then contract won't do any actions.

I'm not sure, what the current logic for the Tact compiler in general, but when I sent in testnet something unexpected by recievers it's just bounced back. It look like, all messages(op-codes) we not expected with receivers bounced.

And you can try send any opcode via ton library.

here not the bestüòÖ example of how to put opcode in Cell msg:

 //TL-B mint#01fb345b amount:int257 = Mint
    let msg = beginCell().storeBuffer(Buffer.from("01fb345b", "hex")).storeInt(amount, 257).endCell();

Text: From a security perspective, does that mean that "if I don't share my .tact file, no one can find bugs in my code?"

- The .ts file helps us interact with the smart contract without getting our hands dirty, as it is generated from the compiled output. It's not possible to reverse engineer the original logic of the code, similar to the .byte code in Solidity.

- To ensure that the receive method is not being called by anyone, it is correct to add as many require statements as possible. However, this may increase gas costs. I am currently unable to determine the difference as I have only tested on the test-net.

Text: where should i specify individual content link for nft?
Reply to: Hi everyone! I just fixed the issue for the previous version of the NFT standard in Tact. Now, you can successfully mint NFT Collections with NFT Items, since after you get the NFT Item in your wallet, you can transfer it through TonKeeper smoothly! üí™üèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è

https://github.com/howardpen9/tact-nft-standard

- There are example URIs for the image content, so you can change it to whatever you need! It's an off-chain content following the TEP64 metadata.

- For the minting process, you need to know that the is_initialized field is defined when the contract is deployed. Once the Item is being minted, it should change to true. (TEP-62)

- The Royalties Fee part has also been successfully implemented following TEP-66; it is now set to a default of 35% in the deploy.ts file. You can change it to whatever you want.

For instance, I encountered an error when I attempted to transfer the NFT on TonKeeper after I minted it.

That's why I had to deploy the contract and test it in production, checking and adding more 'if' cases to account for scenarios such as what would happen if the "forwardPayload" was empty or zero.

Text: there are several ways to update data: 

1. Provide migrated data with new code 
- for this your contract should support seqno (before code update)  to be sure that latest data will be updated 
- data should be migrated offchain and provided for contract 

This method has the disadvantage that any data can be set. Because can be modifyed in any way (e.g. adding or deliting some data outside of migration logic)

2. Contract should support some predefined instruction for modifying data before new code will be set.

3.  I‚Äôm not sure if it possible to send some migration code in Func or Fift that will be executed while migration.

The == operator is used for equality comparisons, not assignments. The correct operator for assignment is =.

Here's an example of the mistake I made:
self.status_A == 3; // üî¥ 
self.status_A = 3; // ‚úÖ


So, if you're assigning a value to a variable, make sure to use a single = sign, not ==. ü•∂üòÇ

Reply to: I made a mistake in my code that took me two days to figure out. I was using the == operator instead of = to assign a value to a variable, but the code still compiled without any errors.

The == operator is used for equality comparisons, not assignments. The correct operator for assignment is =.

Here's an example of the mistake I made:
self.status_A == 3; // üî¥ 
self.status_A = 3; // ‚úÖ


So, if you're assigning a value to a variable, make sure to use a single = sign, not ==. ü•∂üòÇ

Text: Yes, I mean it under manual validating, it's not very convenient, since I want to test scenarios, rather than changes in address. It also teaches me to update snapshots without looking. 

My tests will fail every time when I change the code even scenarios working properly, so I can‚Äôt be sure about why it‚Äôs failed and should validate it manually. It‚Äôs completely ok when I working with something simple, but when I work with some complex scenarios I want to code check and repeat that instead of me. It's much safer especially when you work in a team and not aware about all complex scenarios, but can rely on that they tested.

Reply to: Hi everyone! I just fixed the issue for the previous version of the NFT standard in Tact. Now, you can successfully mint NFT Collections with NFT Items, since after you get the NFT Item in your wallet, you can transfer it through TonKeeper smoothly! üí™üèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è

https://github.com/howardpen9/tact-nft-standard

- There are example URIs for the image content, so you can change it to whatever you need! It's an off-chain content following the TEP64 metadata.

- For the minting process, you need to know that the is_initialized field is defined when the contract is deployed. Once the Item is being minted, it should change to true. (TEP-62)

- The Royalties Fee part has also been successfully implemented following TEP-66; it is now set to a default of 35% in the deploy.ts file. You can change it to whatever you want.

Text: Guys, how to undestand the contract.send method?

There are 4 different types in the wallet.spec.ts:
1. contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, 'notify');
2. contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano('10') }, 'Deploy');
3. contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, null);
4. ```
        contract.send(treasure, { value: toNano(1) }, {
            $$type: 'TransferMessage',
            transfer,

Text: hey guys, I'm currently writing integration of tact with blueprint

.compile.ts looks like this:
import { CompilerConfig } from '@ton-community/blueprint';

export const compile: CompilerConfig = {
    lang: 'tact',
    target: 'contracts/sample.tact',
};

when you run npx blueprint build with the respective name, files get generated as follows:
build/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sample
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.abi
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.code.boc

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.pkg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tact_SampleTactContract.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sample.compiled.json

then there's a file wrappers/Sample.ts that only has one line:
export * from '../build/Sample/tact_SampleTactContract';
so it relies on the files in build folder existing

the spec file has minimal differences, the main one is that compile function is not called since tact embeds code into the resulting ts file

I haven't written a script for deployment yet but I expect it will have minimal differences too

please let me know what you think, especially about that "wrapper depends on files existing in the build folder"
of course also let me know if you have better ideas on how to do this, I haven't spent a lot of time making this and I barely know how tact works

Text: Get Methods in the Tact version will used by the same way, just double check their signature(for example with .md output files or .tact source).

For the WalletV4 contract it was recommended to use the FunC version. There is no implementation of WalletV4 with Tact language.

Tact must be used to create new cross-contract services with complex on-chain business logic.

If I read right your task:
1) Get owner's address from "smart contract"
2) Try to use get method on owner's address.

Perhaps, open-source blockchain explorers could be helpful to research this deeper.

2/ That's why I used a function to calculate the remaining value we need to keep in the contract, building on Steve's previous code.

3/ However, the problem arises when we need to use multiple send transactions (based on one input receive function method). In these cases, we need to properly calculate the remaining value.

Sometimes, the value I wrote like this fails. I suspect this might be due to the dynamic gas cost, which could prevent us from achieving the minimum value we set to keep in the contract.

Text: What is the best recommend to avoid "Integer out of expected range"?


- it will crashed if I assign toNano(10) for the jetton amount that I want to mint with a price_weight - 10n (bigint) tho. 


Thought toNano(10) represent a call to the toNano function with the argument 10, which should convert 10 TON to nanotons, resulting in 10. 000 000 000 nanotons.

Text: ok, made some mistake. 

The length of data type coins is not long enough for jetton amounts. If you can't sure how much jetton token with the totally supply can just set with Int rather then uint32(which is range 0 to 4,294,967,295) - followed by Tact-by-example for more details

Text: Would you like to see an example of a Jetton-ICO template? Check out this link: https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-ico-example/blob/552c545b0e129623cc0856ba7b036a8f661a7d27/sources/contract.tact#L29

Here are some tips for using this template:
- Set the multiplier to determine the amount of Jetton tokens people can get per TON. For example, if you set it to 2500, then 1 TON for minting can get 2500 new Jetton tokens.

- There is a 1.5% fee implemented in TON for fundraising. And only enable withdraw by initial admin.

- In Tact, make sure not to use now() inside the init() function, or your contract code will change addresses based on block height.

- You can set an expiration date based on the starting logical time you want in Unix timestamp.

Text: You can use it as a multiplier, meaning from an altcoin perspective, you can think of it as placing a leveraged bet by investing in the altcoin. If you examine the price correlation chart, you can conclude that in a bull market, it's better to hold onto ETH, but in a bear market, holding altcoins may have more potential for growth. This is why I refer to it as a 'weight' or multiplier from a data standpoint.

On the other hand, from a psychological standpoint, holding a larger amount of any currency feels better regardless of the type. Holding 1 billion Zimbabwean dollars feels better than $1 US dollar, for sure.

Text: Just want to share with you that I just tried to build an example of an NFT staking contract today. You can mint the NFT then:
- Put the NFT into a staking status, although it's not strictly considered staking since the ownership of the NFT doesn't change.
(*Compared with NFTs for sale on Getgems.io, where you have to transition ownership to a new contract.)

- The amount of TON each NFT can claim is based on the Weight it has in the total weight amount of the pool. The weight is based on the duration you choose when  staking.

- To put it simply, if we use the Transfer function(we defined on TEP62)  to stake the NFT, the Transfer function won't be able to bring the information of the NFT itself to the staking contract (e.g. rarity information, level of NFT like we did here in this example).

- But you can still implement your Transfer function with more customized information in custom_payload, although that could make the contract too complicated I guess.

More questions and expansion:
1/ Why don't you design the feature like the NFT sale contract in Getgems.io?

Since the core feature for NFT staking should be based on rarity, I added the Level to the NFT item itself (in code, randomly generated from 1 to 100). This means the ratio of the share you have in the staking pool is based on the level of the NFT itself and the duration you choose, such as 24 hours, 3 days, or more.

2/ What else can we do with this?
Basically, we will need to add a "cool-down" feature, so people can't flash deposit and stake NFT to get a heavy share of weight and then claim the TON coin, etc.

3/ Can we implement Jetton claiming as well?
Sure, we can! But since I think it's easier to implement this staking feature here than staking NFTs and then claiming Jetton tokens.

My question is, how can we ensure that the user is transferring the correct Jetton token into the staking contract?

- I know the staking contract I wrote can functionally support all the transferred tokens, but in our case, we don't want that. 

- In other words, how can we define a "Wallet Contract" that can only receive a specific Jetton token?

- I know the staking contract I wrote can functionally support all the transferred tokens, but in our case, we don't want that. 

- In other words, how can we define a "Wallet Contract" that can only receive a specific Jetton token?

I will say if you want to build any expand contracts like DEXs or Staking contract in Tact, you will need import these functions to fetch the correct Jetton Wallet init_code

These are external messages or "messages to nowhere". They can actually have some kind of  a recipient (just an arbitrary bytes value). They are stored in blocks as any other messages, so you can access them using any preferred API.

Text: Sure, here's your text with improved grammar and an attempt at providing a potential answer:

Fundamentally, a message will be delivered "on-chain", but it won't be directed to any specific address.

However, the current challenge for me is finding an API that can assist in fetching information from the body of the message, so I can decode the message for the emit message I've set.

In this screenshot, it's 0xcdbea1c3.

Text: The practical uses for this feature (please correct me if I'm wrong) are:

1/ Compared to sending a message to a contract, storing it, and then using the get method to read it from on-chain to off-chain, using emit() can help us avoid paying high gas fees to check the data.

2/ Another advantage is the lower latency since you can read the message through the "out message body", decode the message, and get the data we want by fetching the transaction data from the API.

Reply to: One advanced application of msg.forward_payload: Is it possible to append the data of the NFT item itself after the Transfer method has been executed? According to TEP62 here (https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md), they "should be equal".

However, since we can't directly view or fetch information from the NFT itself using view/get function, we have to solely rely on the message.

Text: Yes, that was the purpose for people to easily understand the on-chain transaction since you and your users can check on Explore and know that they were sending the transaction with the comment text to mint the NFT.

You can expand the message (TL-B) format based transaction by changing the Tact file, such as coding Transfer as 0x5fcc3d14.

You can also add more receive method functions and call them using self.mint, which is the internal function we have already defined in the code below.

Need to notice that it's with mode SendRemainingValue tho. It only suitable when you want to send one single message transaction to fallback.

Text: "Good morning, I have been searching for the representation of an int as an alias, I'm not sure if I'm explaining myself correctly. In the 'send' method, it receives a 'SendParameters' object which has a 'mode' property. This property is of type Int, and in a TACT example, I found that they set the 'mode' value to 32+128, but I can't find an explanation. Can someone help me?"

Many of us here are trying to figure out Tact and want to be able to create our own smart contracts. So, I decided to share with you my free course on developing smart contracts in Tact!

The goal is to make entering into the tone of development friendly.

In this course, I've tried to make it as easy as possible to explain all the intricacies I know. We'll start with the basics, from creating and testing a smart contract. 

Lesson Titles: 

Video 1: Introduction to TON

Video 2: Installing and setting up the development environment, the first smart contract

Video 3: Syntax and data types in Tact

Video 4: Messages between contracts, Throwing Errors

Video 5: TON coin sending, working with gas

Video 6: Syntax and data types in Tact 2

Video 7: Traits.

Video 8: From ERC20 to Jetton.

Video 9: The nft collection contract

Video 10: The first dapp on TON integrated with Telegram

Two lessons have been done so far. And please don't forget to forward this message to friends who also want to start developing on TON. We'll make our community stronger together!

Text: Do the mappings in FunC and Tact have the same disadvantages as those in TVM when it comes to sorting values? For example, if I want to build an order-book-based trading system, what would be the best design case for this? Should I structure the order book as an NFT collection, where each OrderID represents an NFT item?

Would that approach help to mitigate the sorting problem and save on gas costs? Even so, we would still need a mapping to store which Int is smaller or larger, right? (I.e., sorting the orders based on an integer value).

Text: Hello everyone, I've shared the repository for the Staking Jetton Example:

1/ For Staking Legic, one of the challenges is learning how to calculate the Jetton Wallet for "each Wallet" that receives the jetton token. Once you understand how to use the "JettonMaster" function from the "ton" SDK, everything becomes much easier.

2/ If you want to list your Jetton token on DEXs like STON.fi or Megaton.fi, remember to launch it using Tact. This is crucial because the initial Jetton code that we write in Tact may differ from FunC. Consequently, you might be "unable" to use the "JettonMaster" function to get the correct jetton wallet address!

3/ Therefore, using the message "AddingJettonAddress" is the recommended way to inject the Jetton Root data into the Staking Contract. I highly recommend launching your jetton token at https://minter.ton.org first, then passing the data to the contract.

Initially, I planned to build the IDO logic in practice, which is why I first built the Staking Contract here to measure the Score.

It's similar to the ve-Curve logic but in a simpler way, as we measure the Size of the Jetton Token you stake, and weight it based on the time you have in the Staking contract.

Then, any contract can call the "GetWeighted" method to fetch the Weight for a user in a message-based way. This approach is more interesting to me than the structures I've seen in Ethereum, and it's an easier way to achieve the same goal.

As you can see in the screenshot, you can test it by transferring different amounts of tokens at various times to obtain different weight results. The diverse design of the Jetton Wallet, where each address stores separate data, allows for greater flexibility in designing your DeFi feature."

As you can see, the value I store in the address changes dynamically even I sent the same amount of TON. 

However, since I pass the same value every time, I can't understand why the ctx.value I store fluctuates significantly.

1/ What causes the ctx.value of the unit we store on the contract to be different (i.e., the gas fee for the validator)?

2/ How can I accurately record how much people 'Stake in TON' for this transaction? This could potentially result in high gas costs if the contract logic is complex.

The solution from getgems.io suggests that users pay more TONcoin when they create an auction contract or call the Transfer function.

Text: Yes, you can utilise merkle proofs for that.

You can use Dictionary as a structure that will hold all users and your smart contract will only need to store the hash of that dictionary.
Reply to: is there any merkle root I can use to store User List? Like the example here?
https://github.com/a16z/eth-testnet-drop

1/ In EVM, the gas cost is so high. So one of the solution is that we only store the merkle root to save the spaces we need on-chain.

2/ We don't have array in Tact, then how we can store a list that with Users Addresses' data? And search, calling it each by each?


I am thinking to use the Collection+Item design like NFTs. Correct me if I am wrong. Thanks...

Text: Specify single argument with init struct.
Reply to: Is that possible to specify somehow the length of an init() argument?
For example, I have such initializer: init(a: Int) { ... } 
Argument a is uint32 but it's stored as int257.

Text: I had share a staking example before üëÄü´£üí™
Reply to: Hello everyone, I've shared the repository for the Staking Jetton Example:

1/ For Staking Legic, one of the challenges is learning how to calculate the Jetton Wallet for "each Wallet" that receives the jetton token. Once you understand how to use the "JettonMaster" function from the "ton" SDK, everything becomes much easier.

2/ If you want to list your Jetton token on DEXs like STON.fi or Megaton.fi, remember to launch it using Tact. This is crucial because the initial Jetton code that we write in Tact may differ from FunC. Consequently, you might be "unable" to use the "JettonMaster" function to get the correct jetton wallet address!

3/ Therefore, using the message "AddingJettonAddress" is the recommended way to inject the Jetton Root data into the Staking Contract. I highly recommend launching your jetton token at https://minter.ton.org first, then passing the data to the contract.

Initially, I planned to build the IDO logic in practice, which is why I first built the Staking Contract here to measure the Score.

It's similar to the ve-Curve logic but in a simpler way, as we measure the Size of the Jetton Token you stake, and weight it based on the time you have in the Staking contract.

Then, any contract can call the "GetWeighted" method to fetch the Weight for a user in a message-based way. This approach is more interesting to me than the structures I've seen in Ethereum, and it's an easier way to achieve the same goal.

As you can see in the screenshot, you can test it by transferring different amounts of tokens at various times to obtain different weight results. The diverse design of the Jetton Wallet, where each address stores separate data, allows for greater flexibility in designing your DeFi feature."

Text: haven't seen docs about it. Tact generates special get_method supported_interfaces that looks like _ supported_interfaces() method_id {
    return (
        "org.ton.introspection.v0"H >> 128,
        "org.ton.abi.ipfs.v0"H >> 128,
        "org.ton.deploy.lazy.v0"H >> 128,
        "org.ton.chain.workchain.v0"H >> 128
    );
}
It could help to exactly understand the interface of communication with the contract. Haven't seen someone supported it, but it looks like a nice feature.
When you add @interface("org.aboba.v1337") the hash of the string inside brackets will be added to the tuple that supported_interfaces get method returns

Text: 0. commit() assures that set_data will have effect even if the transaction fails.
1. If we accept external message but don't commit, then execution failure will lead to contract state not being changed, and the external message will be run (and accepted) again and again ‚Äî probably, until the contract runs out of balance.
2. Wallets are especially prone to failures: insufficient balance, invalid destination address, etc.

Text: Hi people! Probably for this question I will be pelted with pissing rags, but I still dare to ask, because it's time to seriously play Tact.

Actually the question is that, as I understand it, the most reasonable way to test now is a blueprint (or a sandbox, it's not so important), which is written in the documentation (https://docs.tact-lang.org/tools/typescript).

The fact is that as a result of compilation .ts file appears (which, according to the documentation, should be used in sandbox) and it uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton-core And sandbox https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/core is used

So the question is, how do you, colleagues, test? Do you rewirite imports by your hands? What is the fundamental difference either? How is it all brought to a single interface?

If you compile .tact it will create sample_Contract.ts file, which will import
    TupleBuilder,
    DictionaryValue
} from 'ton-core';

but sandbox works on @ton/core

It's two different libs. So it's impossible to use this .ts file in sandbox without fixind lib by hands (its not really good, cuz after build it always needs to be fixed and there is no garantee that interfaces of libs always be the same)

In the Tact docs, it's written that I can use this file with sandbox. So, the question is how? )

Text: Especially, the error in TonViewer is exit code 0.

As you can see, the error comes from 0x178d4519, the standard Jetton Token's TokenInternalTransfer method.

I have dealt with Jetton before, so the code I used is the same as the code I used previously.

Potential ideas:
1/ Because I am using the TonKeeper UI, the forward_ton_amount is less than the code. 

Since the Tact code pays higher gas than FunC's Jetton Token?

2/ (Still thinking and trying to find why...)

Text: Is there any tool that we can use to properly determine the general Gas Cost?

I know people say that FunC is more gas-efficient, but what is the exact percentage comparison between the two languages in general?

Perhaps this could be based on metrics like Jetton Token Transfer, NFT Item Minting, and so on.

We can send two transactions from different contracts (Func/Tact implementation) and measure the difference bettween them.

Text: It‚Äôs a complex question. There cannot be an exact percentage of general difference.

If you still want to complete some benchmarks, at least complete them on several different smart contracts with different implementations

Those TS files are the modules you can use when deploying the contract or fetch the on-chain data.

Text: Great question!

1/ I have set a receive function to inject it. We can only know the "current Staking contract's Jetton Wallet Address" after the Staking contract has been deployed.

2/ The second point is that this approach can prevent front-running. People who want to deposit tokens into the contract could otherwise track the deployer's transactions to gain an advantage.

However, this is not a critical consideration at this stage.ü§ï

Text: Hi everyone, I've just updated my Jetton Token repo:

- It now supports Comment during transfers, similar to the feature available on TonKeeper.

- I've included a max_supply field in my template, as it seems to be important in most cases. This is also emphasized by https://minter.ton.org/.

- I've added instructions for generating a Transfer URL when you're trying to send the Jetton Token to a third person. (In Jetton, if you want to transfer your Jetton Token to someone, you need to send a message to YOUR Jetton Wallet, not to the new recipient's wallet.)

- forward_ton_amount can be set as lower as possible: Same as TelemintNFT. I don't know why, but looks like we can set (1e-9 TON) in forward_ton_amount without any error.

Text: About this error:

Seem's like i used the whole possible limitation for contract size, cause it's have embeded structs. The solution was:

To create your own "bicycle" by using booleans and other low-cost data types for representation for some data. For example i was developing a small game on TON and the struct has tons of fields, some of theme were like
firstPlayer: Address,
secondPlayer: Address,

winner: Address?;

Seems like i used to many bytes, so i changed "winner" field to "bool" type where "true" - firstPlayer, and "false" means secondPlayer

Reply to: Hi guys, can anyone share an example of handling bounced messages? Official docs give the following info, but it's unclear what should I do with src argument. Does it have the same members as original message (I doubt that)?
contract MyContract {
    bounced(src: bounced<MyMessage>) {
        // ...
    }
}

Text: Hi guys!
I found a possible bug in this Tact example from https://tact-by-example.org/06-authenticating-children

This chapter is dedicated to children contract authentification by it's address to make children impersonation impossible. However, children constructor doesn't check that parent address passed as an argument is really a message sender:
    init(parent: Address, seqno: Int) {
        self.parent = parent;
        self.seqno = seqno;
    }

With this code we can create a child from another parent contract and pass Victim parent address as an argument.
Using self.parent = sender() is not an option as it won't affect child address this way.
We can add require(parent == sender() ) to make it secure.

Did I get it right or there's something I've missed?

Text: Good catch! I can help fix this. Thank you.

Correct. If we want to filter specific senders, then adding that line is a reasonable choice.

I think I will update a bit in Tact-template, adding the test case from:
import "@ton-community/sandbox";
import "@ton-community/test-utils";


Current testcase example is using @tact-lang/emulator, I think some people is in confusing when download the Tact-template.

1/ You can't place emit after the self.forward message; it will completely fail and pause the transaction.

2/ You need to measure the GasInStorage as we did in the NFT standard. Then, set the remaining TonCoin value to pass the message and trigger the emit event from the current Smart Contract address.


The method 1 will failed, but nor method 2.

Using invoice: Invoice = self.get_pending_invoice(msg.index)!!;

Text: Hi, I have a few questions regarding Jetton contract in Tact https://github.com/howardpen9/jetton-implementation-in-tact/blob/new_/sources/contract.tact.

For this portion of the TokenTransferInternal message:

         // 0x7362d09c - notify the new owner of JettonToken that the transfer is complete
        if (msg.forward_ton_amount > 0) { 
            send(SendParameters{
                to: self.owner,
                value: msg.forward_ton_amount,
                mode: SendPayGasSeparately + SendIgnoreErrors,
                bounce: false,
                body: TokenNotification {
                    queryId: msg.queryId,
                    amount: msg.amount,
                    from: msg.from,
                    forward_payload: msg.forward_payload
                }.toCell()
            });
        }

1) Is this used to trigger additional logic in the owner contract upon receiving jettons?
2) Is it possible to send other parameters in the TokenNotification message as per this standard? Maybe in forwardPayload? (idk what this param is for tbh)
3) If this is the case, how much forward_ton_amount is set conventionally? Is 1 nanoton enough just so that this code is triggered?

Text: Great questions!

1/ The forward_ton_amount in text refers to "the amount of TonCoin you want to allocate for this TokenNotification messages."

This message format is required to notify the original owner that "He has transferred a certain amount of Jetton to someone."

2/ Correct. You can input whatever you desire, regardless of the parameters you wish to pass. On DeDust.io, the text message is displayed to notify everyone at the explorer level that this Tx is for adding Liquidity, Exit, Swap, etc.

3/ It depends on the action you want the receiver contract to perform. For a standard Transfer reminder in message passing, 10^-9 TonCoin is acceptable.

Text: Oooo thanks! Very interesting mechanism. I was stuck trying to figure out how a contract can trigger a transfer of jettons since there's no transferFrom() and allowances. I guess the transfer happens first which then triggers the subsequent logic. A few other things:

1) for (2) are you referring to inputting into the forward_payload?
2) if so, how would I input a cell containing for example an address and an int?
3) and how would I validate (in the owner contract) that the payload contains the correct number of inputs and are of the correct types?
Reply to: Great questions!

1/ The forward_ton_amount in text refers to "the amount of TonCoin you want to allocate for this TokenNotification messages."

This message format is required to notify the original owner that "He has transferred a certain amount of Jetton to someone."

2/ Correct. You can input whatever you desire, regardless of the parameters you wish to pass. On DeDust.io, the text message is displayed to notify everyone at the explorer level that this Tx is for adding Liquidity, Exit, Swap, etc.

sent 0.1 ton to another address, but just received 0.099691 ton.
I guess because the receiver pays some gas.

how to receive all 0.1 ton, and let the sender pay ALL gas fee?

sent 0.1 ton to another address, but just received 0.099691 ton.
I guess because the receiver pays some gas.

how to receive all 0.1 ton, and let the sender pay ALL gas fee?

Text: Hi, this is a really tough question: "How can I make the current smart contract I've built understand if the sender is the correct NFT item from a specific NFT collection I'm targeting?"

1. In the past, if I deployed the NFT collection simultaneously, it was straightforward. This is because I knew how to calculate each NFT item's address within the smart contract.

2. The issue arises when an NFT item is transferred. It doesn't convey useful information in a consistent manner. This means the contract simply receives OwnershipAssigned(0x05138d91) and can't determine if it's the desired NFT item or not.

1) how do I input a cell containing address an int in the forward_payload field (Slice) of TokeNotification in  the TokenTransferInternal message for Jetton?
2) how can i validate that the payload (Slice) contains the address and the int?
Reply to: Oooo thanks! Very interesting mechanism. I was stuck trying to figure out how a contract can trigger a transfer of jettons since there's no transferFrom() and allowances. I guess the transfer happens first which then triggers the subsequent logic. A few other things:

1) for (2) are you referring to inputting into the forward_payload?
2) if so, how would I input a cell containing for example an address and an int?
3) and how would I validate (in the owner contract) that the payload contains the correct number of inputs and are of the correct types?

Text: 1/ I think from my knowledge in FunC, the sentence should more specific that "Adding more receive method in Tact is more like adding more if-else‚Äôs in FunC. Yes, it‚Äôll cost more gas to execute.

receive(msg: Slice), receive(msg: String), receive() are three different situations.
Reply to: 1. If you write more if-else‚Äôs, yes, it‚Äôll cost more gas to execute.

2. Then why do you even need to split these receivers into a several different ones? Just do receive(){‚Ä¶}

Text: 2. Isn't receive(msg: Slice) {} sufficient for forwarding everything?
Reply to: 1. Does FunC also have the same effect that "more receive methods lead to higher gas costs when receiving messages"?
  
This is super super interesting.

2. I am just testing and trying to write a smart contract that will pass all received messages (Slice, String, null OP, etc.) to the owner's address! 

Then this contract should have a standardized contract that I can implement tho.

1. I thought those receive functions don't affect each other?

2. Why do multiple receive functions increase the gas cost, even when I specify that each receive function is targeting a different use case?

Trying to run get method on non-active contract

      1022 |     async getGetWalletData(provider: ContractProvider) {
      1023 |         let builder = new TupleBuilder();
    > 1024 |         let source = (await provider.get('get_wallet_data', builder.build())).stack;

In this line:
https://github.com/Tarnadas/orderly-ton-amm/blob/master/tests/OrderlyAmm.spec.ts#L172

I'm trying to build integration tests, so trying to mock as few as possible. I used Jetton Tact reference implementation to deploy JettonMaster in my test.

From my understanding this should output the same address, but it doesnt:
console.log('ownerJettonA', ownerJettonA.address);
console.log('await tokenA.getGetWalletAddress(owner.address)', await tokenA.getGetWalletAddress(owner.address));


So I assume this is the reason why I receive this error.
Does anyone have an idea what's going wrong?

Also do I really need the Jetton reference implementation? Could I do this with the JettonMaster from ton library without relying on my own test Jetton code?

Text: Hmmmmm let‚Äôs start again. 
Let‚Äôs say you have 1000bits. In Cell. You can read them ‚Äúforward only‚Äù, so you start by making Slice from Cell. This Slice points to first bit of 1000. You can read 32 bits as int or ‚Äúseveral bits‚Äù as Address (address size can vary). You must know what was stored to read correctly. If it was stored as uint256 but you read it as uint32‚Ä¶ you will receive wrong value. 
So once your read,say, 32 bits - your slice ‚Äúpointer‚Äù moved forward and you have 1000-32 bits remaining

Reply to: Hmmmmm let‚Äôs start again. 
Let‚Äôs say you have 1000bits. In Cell. You can read them ‚Äúforward only‚Äù, so you start by making Slice from Cell. This Slice points to first bit of 1000. You can read 32 bits as int or ‚Äúseveral bits‚Äù as Address (address size can vary). You must know what was stored to read correctly. If it was stored as uint256 but you read it as uint32‚Ä¶ you will receive wrong value. 
So once your read,say, 32 bits - your slice ‚Äúpointer‚Äù moved forward and you have 1000-32 bits remaining

Text: did you figured out this?
Reply to: It seems I'm sending messages in some wrong way, because test results are the same when I use send() and when I don't use them at all.

For example for Task 4, for sending NFT - should msg be sent with value = 0 and mode = SendRemainingValue, or with some fixed value and mode = 3?
Should it have forwardAmount and forwardPayload or not?

i tried batches 254, 100 and 1
i tried auto-withdraw profit after all nft
i tried same and different msg type for "retry"
i tried 0 and 0.01 forwardAmount

I think this is one of the reasons .
and another one is that you said limiting ...
also we have more too.

Text: According to the jetton specification, each user has their own JettonWallet. And we are given only two jettonWallets. And the sender can be either an admin or another user. Which doesn't look like the specification. We don't have a wallet code to get the user's jettonWallet address. Also we have notifications coming from two given jettonWallets. And according to the specification notifications should come from our jettonWallet, and there should be two of them.

Unit testing is indeed a powerful method for identifying bugs and optimizing gas usage, but it truly shines when we have a thorough understanding of every checkpoint and detail in our specification. Therefore, if we successfully pass all the test cases, local testing becomes crucial. It is important to consider that if we lack insight into how the server conducts the tests (how they implement their underlying contracts), writing tests may only help us identify issues that we are already aware of.

Reply to: This is not really fair to those who started the development in TON with TACT. I worked hard to finish the tasks, but now my position is the same as the people who completed 4 tasks. Because people by abusing their knowledge are at the top of the table by using nativeSendMessage. So this is not the challenge of the new language, it is the challenge of bypassing the limitations of the new language.

Docs:
nativeReserve calls native raw_reserve function with specified amount and mode.
The raw_reserve() is a function that creates an output action to reserve a specific amount of nanotoncoins from the remaining balance of the account.

your source balance 200

you recieve msg with X tons for gas, you balance is 200+X after recieve phase

execution of your code (compute phase) spend some gas Y, so you have balance 200+X-Y, and you created "output action" to reserve 100 and second output action to send msg with SendRemainingBalance.

in action phase, "reserve 100" executed and now you have "available" balance 200+X-Y-100, which will be sent with SendRemainingBalance

+4 - Increase amount by the original balance of the current account (before the compute phase)

so nativeReserve(100, 0+4) will reserve 200 (source) +100, so last msg will send
200+X-Y-(200+100)
so it will fail if X is less than 100+Y

Text: let's say X is 200, Y is 75, and we send a message with SendRemainingValue. Would nativeReserve(100, 0) and nativeReserve(100, 4) be the same thing?
Because incoming message's value is always used first, Y and nativeReserve(100, z) would also be spent/reserved from the incoming value. And so sending remaining value would result in 25 nanotoncoins being sent back regardless, right?

Also to add to the discussion, I'd guess that +8 flag would be for unreserving an amount of nanotoncoins

Text: My solutions for Tact Challenge: https://github.com/aSpite/tact-challenge-contracts.

I added a README in which I described almost all the optimizations in order to make it convenient to read the code. There are also some points about inaccurate tests. 

The most interesting hacks:

- Storing the address as uint256 since Tact uses tact_verify_address every time an address is received, which consumes a lot of gas.

- Using commit (c4 and c5 saving) and throw(0) to abruptly exit the function when you only need to send a message without changing storage.

- The correct order of data storage in the storage. It is important to understand how Tact works with storage. It depends on which value will be the first on the stack. With the correct sequence of values used and their location in the storage, a significant improvement in gas can be achieved.

Text: Because storeCoins(ton('0.01')) stores 28 bits of data.

storeCoins stores VarUint16, which means that the first 4 bits indicate how many bytes are needed to store the number. In this case, the number 10000000 fits in 24 bits, which makes 3 bytes. The first 4 bits contain the number 3, and the next 24 bits (3) bytes are the number itself. It turns out 28 bits + zero bit for custom payload

Text: Slice is for reading. If you need 3rd int32 - you need to read two first (no need to store them anywhere)

To change slice - you must create new cell and rewrite it all. Two unchanged int32 first (so you have to store them in variables while reading), then new 3rd, then unchanged 4th. Then endCell() and store it where needed.

Text: No, I hope they add this
for now, you can use an indexer for it.
if your key has Int type you can do it via `next_item_index: Int` or even for a cyclical array
if your key has Address type you should use extra map as indexer key_store: map<Int, Address>

Text: good question, because you had an force load for item that doesn't exist so you had error in process:
let userAddress: Address = msg.userAddressMap.get(i)!!;
I have an suggestion for you same as Tact's docs, use a checker before reading data from maps:
if(msg.userAddressMap.get(i) != null) {
    let userAddress: Address = msg.userAddressMap.get(i)!!;
    self.tests.set(userAddress, 132123);
}
you are forcing map reader via !! that mean you are ensure map has value at this key, avoid that

The most show-case example is NFT standart, where each NFT item has it's own address. Then how can i know if NFTItem already been minted?

I updated to this code and the contract deployed successfully and even the nft item

But I am not able to check that nft on getgems

this was the deployed nft collection address

https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQCCpCthkU22GKuEoXkcD3XMuSze6jowy46U-3FRPrLwsstO

It is saying that this address is not an nft

Since nft item init state may only related to collection address and index (depends on your usecase), therefore you can calculate their address by initOf.

Text: I have just tested by a simple contract, which contains two receive functions with almost identical logic (target: to preserve about 1 TON in our contract), but the only difference is nativeReserve and deduct it from context directly. 

In summary, native reserve costs 0.0127 gas unit, whereas deduct method costs  0.012215. 

Thus, native reserve is a bit more expensive but more accurate. (native reserve exactly remain 1 TON in contract, but meanwhile dedeuct method will remain about 0.991 in the contract)

Text: @zerex , what you think about this solution.
You craft your entry contract such that it will receive some parameters and initiate another contract for one nft(this means sharding in smart contract design pattern). Discuss here.
https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons

As any sub contract is also a contract and has a unique address , you craft your main contract such that it sends an external message, in this case initial hash or new address .Then your layer 3 app listens for any updates and has arbitrary business logic for any purpose.
So two entities are in your hand without needing to touch Blockchain, doing everything you need without any gas .
For future reference also you can utilize them . I assume some fundamental concepts of how TVM and Smart contract work are already available in  mind .For clearance I am open discussing more.Maybe I am wrong.

Text: I respectfully disagree with your viewpoint. My proposed solution leverages an extensive array of entities, addresses, or smart contracts with minimal storage fees. The subcontract in question requires only a small balance for occupation (storage fee), remaining in standby until activated as needed (following the actor model). This design ensures code capability, providing advantages such as extensibility, configurability, and upgradability. The solution is designed for ease of maintenance and facilitates straightforward owner changes for future needs, which are crucial for our specific use case.

I am intrigued by the concept of indexing you mentioned and would appreciate further clarification. I am concerned about the potential overcomplication of our code and whether time-based indexing is necessary, given the inherent collision resistance of these entities.

He needs real-time information that can only be provided through the main contract or off-chain at mint.

1. You don't need to check if mint request is greater than last item. Just send mint message, that's all.
2. NFT should respond with error if it's already initialized. Bouncing isn't the best solution since it can lose user address (or it could be kept in StateInit, but that should be checked separately).

Text: ‚ùì One question: What is the best way to do the sorting?

I am considering implementing the liquidation feature in TON. 

However, a contract in TON shouldn't store all the contract statuses (for example, we usually don't recommend using map<Int, Int> in this manner).

If I store the status in each Balance contract (let's say), then how can we sort all the contract values and select the lowest value from each contract?

Text: Hello, the question is whether one contract can own several jetton wallets (jetton type, master and owner are the same, but the jw addresses are different), and uniqueness can be achieved by passing an additional seqno field to jw init, so that contractAddress always returns a unique address ?
Or the original idea is to have one contract which owns only 1 jetton wallet with tokens of a certain type?

We aim to make the Tact language as good as possible for developers. You can help improve the Roadmap by participating in a survey.

The survey consists of 7 questions, but it's crucial to reveal your experience so Anton can tailor the Tact language to your needs:

Text: TON20 Inscription Use-case on TON
Starting on December 5th, The Open Network (TON) experienced an incredible spike in network activity, thanks to the BRC20 Bitcoin Ordinals type of inscription use-case, called TON20, launched by the Tonano team. 

Producing over 2 million transactions increased our network usage by 61 times within just half an hour. TON Community is proud to witness a creative use case take-off in TON driven by independent participants in the ecosystem.

Moreover, this sudden growth has revealed many interesting insights for our blockchain. Dynamic sharding technology worked as expected. At its peak, TON split into eleven shardchains, stabilizing at five shardchains to handle the heavy load.

At the same time, this phenomenon also revealed where the community should work to swiftly onboard the exponential increase in network activity expected in the near future. Network validators must ensure that TON is supported by hardware capable of scaling to the performance demanded by high usage.

Network Performance Delays
This peak interest also came with a severe congestion of TON network, where validation was severely delayed even though the network validators are still producing blocks. 

Popular wallets like @Wallet and Tonkeeper have paused the service temporarily.

TON core developers are aware of the issues affecting users and are working on TON blockchain. An initial technical report is available here. TON core team will be providing us with a further update within the next 24 hours. 

We thank you and the community for your patience and unwavering support as we go through the growing pains together, preparing for the unprecedented growth season expected in the near future.

Text: Call for Network Validators to get in contact!
The TON blockchain is experiencing reduced performance now due to a backlog of transactions in the queue to be validated. We‚Äôve received a fantastic response from many validators on the network who have already upgraded using the patch provided this morning.

However, there are still some we have been unable to reach. We need to collect the machine specifications from all validators to progress the upgrade as quickly as possible. If you maintain a TON validator node, please get in touch with us urgently so we can resolve the network performance issues. 

You can reach the team via this google form. If you know someone who maintains a validator node on TON, please also feel free to forward this message.

Text: Note, that since there is a limit on max cell-depth <1024, and particularly the limit on c4 and c5 depth <=512, there will be a limit on the number of output actions in one tx <=255. If a contract needs to send more than that, it may send a message with the request continue_sending to itself and send all necessary messages in subsequent transactions.

Text: However, this should have been processed by TON. This was expected from the design of TON and sharding system. It must be ensured that such an incident will not be repeated, even if it was repeated deliberately with higher scales. I'm sure the TON core team are the best to prevent this from happening again and will do their best to keep TON stable

Text: However, we can achieve this with a little change in the compiler, and instead of reading the code line by line, we use a function to load the structure from a json file, so our build output can be very simplest and serialize/deserialize can be possible.
we can use this schemas to generate API/Front codes and any RAD tools top of this resources

Text: Hi guys)! I want to continue my questions about map type.

ok, let's say we changed our mind about storing strings)

1. and i decided to store 1000 'bool' type in a map<Int as uint8, Int as uint256> of 4 elements (250 'bool-bits' in each uint256). how much will it cost the contract per year? Based on the calculations here: about 0.00072 TON + a little over 4 uint8?

2. or let's say i decided to store another - map<Int as uint16, Int as uint256> of 1000 elements and also in the contract. Then it will cost : approximately 0.184 + 0.012 TON per year.

Is that right? or how is the map stored in the contract, will it be more expensive?
Reply to: if your contract has only 1 storage props and that is same type map<Int, StringValue> and your string size are less than 1024, you have to pay ~1 TON for storage per year, that mean 100,000 TON per year,

Text: yes, that's what I'm talking about) my question is about the cost of storage. tell me pls, am I doing the calculation for the map correctly for storing 4 uint256. or will it be more expensive? since, 256 * 4 + 4 the key will be more than 1023 bits and 1+ cells is obtained.. and it will be more expensive?

Text: using 4 int256 (into one cell) does NOT need using any map.
if you want to use map - it will take more space (and cells) of course. You may try to store them in testnet and check storage length in explorers, or check dic serialization algorithm to understand how complex it is.

Is it on master chain ? At the end we should have a database mechanism to find those instruction and bring them in scope. Anybody can help?

Why this question is important,  because in smart contract that have huge usecase , like wallet by using this technique we can reduce storage fee significantly,  like v5 of tonkeeper, in their repo , they said we used shared library,  in master chain .

Text: nativeReserve
Reply to: I have just tested by a simple contract, which contains two receive functions with almost identical logic (target: to preserve about 1 TON in our contract), but the only difference is nativeReserve and deduct it from context directly. 

In summary, native reserve costs 0.0127 gas unit, whereas deduct method costs  0.012215. 

Thus, native reserve is a bit more expensive but more accurate. (native reserve exactly remain 1 TON in contract, but meanwhile dedeuct method will remain about 0.991 in the contract)

Text: I've been trying to get help from the community to turn the contract around for 4 days now!
I admit, I have no experience in creating smart contracts and may be asking primitive and possibly stupid questions.

But logically it's simple, there is a contract on tact (it works ) 

We need to deploy it 
1. to do this you need to deploy an environment (blueprint, ton emulator or nudjan.io
2. to deploy it you need to edit several files, because the most complicated part is the contract itself (50% of the code is already there).
3. Deploy to testnet then to mainnet

What I have already done:
I deployed an empty blueprint (npx blueprint test npx blue print run worked) here is the created contract
https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQCsmbdWOCYeTkTnZb0yizoRr9k_p6Bi2qJjCp2wwFw4MgOp

Here is the main contract - https://github.com/wety-dev/jackpot-ton/blob/main/jackpot-ton.tact

What do I need to add?

paste the jackpot-ton.tact code into contracts/toncoin.tact
I assume that I need to make changes to the files
build/toncoin/tact_Toncoin.ts and scripts/deployToncoin.ts.

But I don't know what code should be added or edited?

Text: does anyone try to implement on-chain data in Tact level?

Basically put the string data into the cell in dictionary. I think using map<Cell, Info>

struct Info {
  symbol: String;
  name: String;
}
?

Text: hi all, I have the wired error that only happend when contract deployed a few hours later:

here is my code:
    get fun calculateMintPerTime(): Int {
        let remainingAmount: Int = self.max_supply!! - self.total_supply;

        // Calculate the remaining seconds
        let remainingSenconds: Int = self.start_time + (self.total_Duration!! * 3600) - now();
        if (remainingSenconds > 0) {

        } else {
            return remainingAmount;
        }
    }

We suspect the error stems from a division issue, causing the same error Code: 4 even when this method is called through get method. 

Does anyone know how to avoid this?

add/update jettonWalletAddress for your sale contract manually, and set address from ton explorer after deploying sale contract.


1. deploy sale contract
2. use your master contract api to get walletAddress by account address (your sale contract address)
3. update wallet address in sale contract

Text: Hello everyone, we're currently developing a project on ton and currently on testing phase so we're facing problem with high prices for transactions. We have like 5 contracts, which communicating with each other, and some simple transaction with NFT transfer+ store a few bits on-chain costs almost 0.5 TON. 

Since we are building gasless system for our users, it makes very difficult to always have balance on dev accounts (and it's also costs lotts of money).

So we're currently looking for an option to "batch" our transactions, is there a way?

Since we are building gasless system for our users, it makes very difficult to always have balance on dev accounts (and it's also costs lotts of money).

So we're currently looking for an option to "batch" our transactions, is there a way?

yes, but i'm also trying to keep attributes that the contract calculates itself, accordingly, i create StringBuilder : with the necessary type/values.

    attr.append("[{'trait_type':'attrName1','value':'");
    attr.append(data.attrName1.toString());
    attr.append("'},{ ............many attributes..........").
    // ...many other attributes
 But if the final string takes up more than 1 Cell, then storeSlice does not allow this to be done (the method stops with an error), that is, i am looking for a best practice, a way (as far as possible in Tact) to create from string of more than 1 cell and save it as onchain data in the correct snake format for NFT.

Reply to: hi Yuri, looks like something like the following should work:


git clone https://github.com/tact-lang/tact
cd tact
yarn build && yarn gen

cd TO-YOUR-PROJECT-FOLDER
npm install PATH-TO-YOUR-CLONED-TACT-FOLDER


Basically, it‚Äôs a local package installation. Worked for a Blueprint-based Tact project

Text: Hello guys, I'm importing a common contract into two different others, since I need addresses calculated given the InitData.
Though, I'm not getting the same address for both given the same InitData.
I investigated a little bit and found out that the generated FunC code for the same imported contract was different for each context in just one place, the IPFS link for the ABI.
Since the IPFS CID should be the same if the files are equal, I've taking a look at the generated ABI for each case and noticed that there're exit codes that doesn't belong to the common contract, the one I want the address to be calculated, but from the contracts that it's being imported into.

‚Äî  Readability boost with underscores in large numbers: 1000000000 ¬ª¬ª  1_000_000_000
‚Äî  Added binary and octal literals: 0b1010_0101, 0o4242_0376 
‚Äî  Added support for ternary conditional operators let foo: Int = your_condition ? 42 : 0 .
‚Äî  The equality and non-equality operators (==¬†and¬†!=) now support slices and strings by comparing the hashes of the left-hand and right-hand sides.

Both the official VS Code plugin for Tact and tact.vim have been updated with the new features. 

Happy Coding!

Text: Anyone know why I have this problem?
Reply to: Hello guys, I'm importing a common contract into two different others, since I need addresses calculated given the InitData.
Though, I'm not getting the same address for both given the same InitData.
I investigated a little bit and found out that the generated FunC code for the same imported contract was different for each context in just one place, the IPFS link for the ABI.
Since the IPFS CID should be the same if the files are equal, I've taking a look at the generated ABI for each case and noticed that there're exit codes that doesn't belong to the common contract, the one I want the address to be calculated, but from the contracts that it's being imported into.

Text: As I understand, TON contracts are supposed to be as compact as possible. Let me give a comparison.

In Ethereum, contracts have a "monolith" structure; that is, a single (possibly huge) contract can store a list of a myriad of items (tokens, NFTs, etc.) in itself. And when a new item is to be added to the list, a new transaction occurs, extending the size of the contract.

On the other hand, in TON the situation is completely different. TON blockchain works with the "actor model," and this is one the cornerstones of its infinite scalability. In this model, instead of a single giant contract, we have a composite structure of relatively small-sized contracts, consisting of a "parent" contract together with lots of "child" contracts, each of which storing a single item of the list as compared to the above monolithic Ethereum contract. And whenever a new item is to be added to the list, a message is sent to the parent contract which, in turn, generates a new child contract containing the newly added item. This way, infinite extendibility of the list of items is guaranteed in TON ecosystem.

Now, returning to your question, I would kindly recommend you to keep your contracts as compact as possible, and instead try to utilize the actor model of TON. I'm sure you will achieve better results this way.

I am facing the following problem. During development I used blueprint framework, and I wrote some scripts to interact with contracts in Type Script. I would like to be able to run them from a program, for example to make a website, and on clicking a button - execute the script. I've run into the problem that I can't get a NetworkProvider.

Reply to: Good afternoon,
I am facing the following problem. During development I used blueprint framework, and I wrote some scripts to interact with contracts in Type Script. I would like to be able to run them from a program, for example to make a website, and on clicking a button - execute the script. I've run into the problem that I can't get a NetworkProvider. Are there any guides on how to do this? I would be very grateful

Text: I dont think so, of course since tact is a simpler language, I guess people will make simpler things and store more stuff than needed. But it really depends on what kind of processing the language do in  the end. If a function from tact that compiles in func do 10 operations, and you can do the same with 4 operations in func, probably it will cost more. That would be the normal if you use a higher level language. Is like comparing C# against c++ or assembler. The lower the level of the language, the more optimized it is.

Text: At this moment, Jetton Transfers may incur twice the gas cost in Tact.

However, there is certainly room for improvement. The higher-level language has more structured patterns, which should allow for optimization at the compiler level.

Although, as of now, Tact is more of a transpiler that helps you generate FunC code after you compile your Tact-lang code.

Text: Let me put it this way: I‚Äôd say Tact is prototype-ready at this moment. It‚Äôs a great solution to create your MVP and encode the core of your business-logic in Tact, interfacing with some manually optimized FunC code when there is gas pressure. There is at least one serious project that utilizes this approach. The output FunC code that Tact produces can be suboptimal in many cases but this is to be expected since Tact is a more high-level language. The Tact team will be working on gas optimizations, though, as soon as we finish the features outlined in the Tact roadmap. You can checkout how these features and bugfixes are spread across different milestones here: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/milestones. Our main priority are UX improvements and compiler correctness now. We are going to have Tact‚Äôs implementation checked by a top-notch software security audit firm and also we are building our own security-ensuring tools, like a compiler fuzzer: https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/issues/133.

Text: Tact by far is way better than FunC if you‚Äôre familiar with JS and TS it will flow right in
Reply to: BTW you did an extraordinary work. Tact looks amazing and very dev-friendly, based on what I've read at the documentation. I'm sure it will attract a lot of new developers to the TON in the future and will dramatically reduce the adoption curve.

The choice between these two languages shouldn't be done lightly right now. It's more complicated.

it utilizes merkle trees. without merkle updates but if you understand and implement the rest of it in your project, adding merkle updates won't be hard.

Text: Hello!
I am needing a little help with a very basic question.
I've deployed for the first time an smart contract, as a simple test I was using 03-send-coins sample from TACT site and added only 1 more receive with other parameters.
But when deployed in production I've sent 0.05 TON with Tonhub wallet and I got back 0.041841 TON.
Then I've sent to the contract again 0.05 but got back 0.046926 TON.
Does it means that there is an error when processing the messages?

But I haven't found any library for tact to do so. Is there any simple way to implement it?

Reply to: Hey guys. I have a method that accepts private key and returns public key based on input:


get fun get_public_key_from_private_key(private_key: String): String {
    // need to do smth to get public key
    let public_key: String = private_key;

    return public_key;

Text: Hello everyone! I'm delving into Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) and their implementation possibilities within blockchain frameworks. HTLCs are key for enabling secure, conditional, and time-bound transactions, making them essential for things like cross-chain trades and other trustless protocols. I'm particularly curious about implementations in the Tact language. Does anyone here have experience with HTLCs in Tact, or know of any resources or examples? Any guidance or examples you could provide would be incredibly helpful. Thanks!

According to my understanding if len<=16 then value takes max 128 bits, while len takes (15?) bits. But you don't need 15 bits to store a value up to 16 (you only need 5 bits). What am I missing here?

The only work around I thought of is to send() a message to the same address of the contract.

I want to test it with blueprint tests. I'm trying to run:
const data = beginCell();
data.storeUint(123,32);
data.endCell();

// validatorPrivateKey is the key for self.public_key in contract
const signature = naclSign(data.asCell().hash(), validatorPrivateKey);
const signatureSlice = beginCell().storeBuffer(signature).endCell();

const result = await nftCollection.getVerifySign(data.asCell(), signatureSlice);

P.S. naclSign is an alias for nacl.sign from ton-crypto

Text: Found the solution. For those who encounter a similar issue, this may happen when you have a getter function that defines a return type but does not actually return stuff.

Not easy to spot, IDE won't highlight and Tact too won't show an error

Text: Jettons on TON need their own wallet. It‚Äôs not EVM. Logic as follow:
WalletA owns JettonA via WalletAA (which is created automatically)

When you send to FooContract, which is your  contract, JettonA creates a JettonA wallet (new contract) that has as owner FooContract. So your contract never really stores Jettons, it‚Äôs being assigned new wallets for their respective jettons

Text: I couldn't find any documentation on how to take fees from the context value. For example, the contract will charge 1 TON for a certain service.

- SendRemainingValue will just return all the tons minus the blockchain fees
- Using send() means that it's going to essentially "refund" in a different message, so the person would "receive" Tons as if it's a new transaction to them

Anyway to do this without option 2, where we just deduct the 1 TON from the value and SendRemainingValue?

I need to link a Jetton to a contract and be able to manage them through it, essentially creating a sort of buffer for the transaction (send, store, hold until the owner unlocks). Where can I find the most up-to-date Jetton wallet written in Tact so that I can deploy it from my other contract (and I also want to understand if this is the right approach)? Are there any examples available?

Text: Hi just a bump on this, appreciate anyone's help
Reply to: Hey everyone, I'm trying to write a contract that implements Jetton.

So in my buy function, I am running into quite alot of issues when trying to send TON to someone.


receive(msg: Buy) {
    let price: Int = self.calculatePrice(self.totalSupply, msg.amount);
    let shareFee: Int = price * self.shareFeePercent / 100;
    let forwardFee: Int = context.readForwardFee();
    require(context().value >= price + shareFee + forwardFee, "Not enough value");
    
    // send funds code, see below
    // ...
    // send funds code, see below

    self.mint(...);
}


I'm unsure what parameters I should be putting here, as using SendPayGasSeparately always fails my transaction. 


// A
send(SendParameters{
    to: self.owner,
    value: shareFee,
    bounce: false,
    body: SendShareFeeSuccess{ amount: shareFee }.toCell(),
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors + SendPayGasSeparately
});
// B
send(SendParameters{
    to: self.owner,
    value: shareFee + forwardFee,
    bounce: false,
    body: SendShareFeeSuccess{ amount: shareFee }.toCell(),
    mode: SendIgnoreErrors
});

Reply to: Hello guys! Does anyone knows are there testable Jettons contracts? I am creating a smart contract that manages jettons. For example, it can store and send USDT. Are there test jetons so that I can create them, top up and debit the balance from them in tests?

Text: Heyüëã

For example I have a v3 wallet and I have a USDT jetton contract that is owned by my v3 wallet.
Can I somehow calculate what my jetton address will be? Is it predefined or its created when you first send some jettons like in solana?

Text: storeCoins stores 28 bits of data
Reply to: Because storeCoins(ton('0.01')) stores 28 bits of data.

storeCoins stores VarUint16, which means that the first 4 bits indicate how many bytes are needed to store the number. In this case, the number 10000000 fits in 24 bits, which makes 3 bytes. The first 4 bits contain the number 3, and the next 24 bits (3) bytes are the number itself. It turns out 28 bits + zero bit for custom payload

Text: all contracts must pay fees for storing data on-chain.
if your contract stops paying these fees (for example, you withdraw all its balance), it'll become frozen after some time, and if it's frozen for long enough, it'll get deleted from blockchain completely.

transaction history could still be visible, though, but there are no guarantees that it will be visible forever.

Text: Since a DEX is highly transaction-intensive, we still recommend building on FunC. However, it also requires more time to learn and build, so you need to assess your project scope and team size to determine which language to use.

Text: When working with different protocols, I cannot be sure that I will always have enough gas.
Will bounce work if I set mode: SendBounceIfActionFail and run out of gas while performing actions?

As far as I understand, enough gas must be reserved for bounce in this case.

Text: Oh, you are the owner of the git repository that contains the jetton example. I just have questions about your implementation) Can you answer if it‚Äôs not difficult?

1) For example, why in jetton.tack#L211 such a balance check, we use safeMath by default, so it should be replaced with require(self.balance >= msg.amount, "Invalid amount");
 before subtraction.

2) Why is response_destination of type address?, although in TEP-74 this parameter is set explicitly. Should it be address and may have value address(0,0)?

3) Why don't we use mode: SendBounceIfActionFail in burn/mint receivers, since we don't have gas checks there?

In general, thanks for the example, it‚Äôs very clear and helps in understanding architecture!

Reply to: 3) however, if you want to start up TVM in order to process something on the other side, you need to attach at least 0.0001 TON. And if the receiving contract doesn't call "accept_message", you'll need to attach even more to cover gas fees

Text: Hello everyone!
Who can help me?)

Im trying to send message to JettonWallet of my contract. Before this I sent some amount of Jettons there from another wallet. But something wrong and after 'revoke' self.state is in OfferClosed state, but JettonWallet of this contract is still has jettons. 


```     
     receive("revoke") {
        require(self.owner == sender(), "Offer could be revoked only by poster.");
        require(self.state == OfferPublished, "Cant revoke job. ");
        self.send_deposit(self.owner, self.price);
        self.state = OfferClosed;
    }

    fun send_deposit(address: Address, amount: Int) {
        let init: StateInit = initOf TokenWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);  
        let my_jetton_address: Address = contractAddress(init);
        let forward_destination: Int = ton("0.91");
        send(SendParameters{
            to: my_jetton_address, 
            value: 0,
            mode: SendRemainingValue, 
            bounce: false,
            body: Transfer{ // 0x0f817ea5
                query_id: 0,
                amount: amount,
                destination: address,
                response_destination: address,
                custom_payload: beginCell().endCell(),
                forward_ton_amount: forward_destination,
                forward_payload: beginCell().endCell().asSlice(),
            }.toCell(),
            code: init.code,
            data: init.data
        });
```
Here is peace of tests:

// revoke
        let res = await jobOffer.send(
            poster.getSender(),
            {
                value: toNano(1.64)
            },
            "revoke"
        )
        JOData = await jobOffer.getJobData()
        assert(JOData.state == 6n) // passed
        
        poster_data = await posterJettonWallet.getGetWalletData()
        log(fromNano(poster_data.balance), "Poster balance after revoke") //did not changed

        OfferContractData = await jobOfferJettonWallet.getGetWalletData()
        log(OfferContractData.balance, "Offer balance after") // did not changed


Or how can I debug this casee

Rewrite nft-fixprice-sale-v3r3.fc this contract from func to tact. And is func contract op-code == 2 & op-code == 0, but in op-codes.fc there is no op-code that returns 0 or 2 value. Maybe this op-codes there is by default in lang?

Text: Hello everyone,

I'm encountering a problem while testing a smart contract written in Tact language. I use the printTransactionFees(result.transactions) function to observe transaction details, and I notice that the transaction fails as expected with a specific exit code. However, when I run a check to verify the transaction status, it unexpectedly shows success: true. Here's the check I'm using: expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
    from: hashedTimeLockTON.address,
    to: receiver,
    success: false,
});

Could you please help me about this:
I have a code snippet in Tact language for emitting an event in bellow:
receive("transfer") {
    emit(TransferEvent{amount: ton("1.25"), recipient: sender()}.toCell());
}

My question is how to listen that emit event from scripts/frontend.
Actually i need the code to listen for this event.
Hope to receive help from you guys.
Thank you in advance!

Text: I've encountered the same problem. There seems to be a bug that generates the interfaces for imported contracts with a bit different sorting order when you code is generated for different contracts. And then this interfaces with different sorting are hashed to construct the IPFS link and that link get's embedded into your contracts source code (! that's a very bad thing it's not on demand). And that's what makes the source code and thus the resulting addresses differ.

Unfortunately I have no solution, we've finished our prototype with a workaround and are done with Tact for now.

Help please. Cant move on. Can give a few TON reward for helping. 

Intro:
1) I created a custom contract something like JobOffer. It should has own JettonWallet and manage jettons based on its state.

2) I created test environment but could not test because of here is dificulty for JettonWallet addresses, JettonWallets states and so on..II think I'm blind and I'm missing something important or making a base mistake

I think i send excess TON to this function. In list transaction, the latest one is seem not correct somehow, and the second is my happy case (burn token)

How much TON does contract send? How much destination address receives?

randomInt (from tact) - generates random number
randomize_lt (from func) - set random seed for random generator with current logical time (equivalent to randomize(cur_lt()))

Basically,
nativeRandomizeLt (from tact) is equivalent to randomize_lt (from func)
randomInt (from tact) is equivalent to random (from func)

and under the hood it uses native func functions:

From: Creator
Text: Hi everyone. 
This is a question, maybe you know the reason for this awkward situation.

Im trying to create contract, which  must manage jettons on JettonDefaultWallet. I use the default JettonDefaultWallet and JettonMaster.

But in the contract it gives a different result than when I ask JettonMastera for the JettonVolet address at the my contract address. I thought this was in a test environment. But it‚Äôs the same on the testnet. And everything seems to be according 
to the manual.


let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);
        let wallet_address: Address = contractAddress(init);


Func:


((slice, slice, slice, int, slice, slice, (int, int), int, int, slice), ()) $JobOffer$_fun_send_deposit((slice, slice, slice, int, slice, slice, (int, int), int, int, slice) $self, slice $address, int $amount) impure inline_ref {
    var (($self'order, $self'title, $self'description, $self'price, $self'owner, $self'doer, ($self'job_state'doer, $self'job_state'owner), $self'state, $self'is_locked, $self'jetton_master)) = $self;
    var ($ctx'bounced, $ctx'sender, $ctx'value, $ctx'raw) = __tact_context_get();
    var ($init'code, $init'data) = $JettonDefaultWallet$_init_child(__tact_context_sys, my_address(), $self'jetton_master);
    slice $to = $global_contractAddress(($init'code, $init'data));
    $global_send($SendParameters$_constructor_to_value_mode_body_data_code($to, 0, (64 | 2), $TokenTransfer$_store_cell($TokenTransfer$_constructor_query_id_amount_sender_response_destination_custom_payload_forward_ton_amount_forward_payload(0, $amount, my_address(), $address, end_cell(begin_cell()), 100000000, $Cell$_fun_asSlice(end_cell(begin_cell())))), $init'data, $init'code));
    return (($self'order, $self'title, $self'description, $self'price, $self'owner, $self'doer, ($self'job_state'doer, $self'job_state'owner), $self'state, $self'is_locked, $self'jetton_master), ());
}



And it turns out that the only way out is to transfer the init + data code for the flight token manually after deployment. But this is kind of an ugly solution. Perhaps you know what the problem is in the story now.


Thank you

Text: Hi all. 

I have a question, maybe someone knows the answer or at least where to dig. I'm using the contract to manage Jettons on his own wallet. In the contract code I get its address:


let init: StateInit = initOf TokenWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);


But of course I want to use the code of some popular tokens, like USDT.
How can I put code here when compiling a contract, for example this wallet https://tonviewer.com/EQDmVdCZ2SALvyfCDVlPLr0hoPhUxgjNFtTAxemz9V_C5wbN?section=code

Thanks everyone!

Text: Scaling. The problem with EVM model is the atomic transaction nature. You either do everything in single transaction, or you cannot do it at all. It is somewhat like having one enourmous database with everything on single machine vs splitting that database into shards. System complexity in TON model is definitely higher, but it is scalable.

Text: hey guys, I have a question about gas usage and error handling. 

Say I got some complex logic with many contracts user -> contractA -> contractB -> C -> D and I get an error or lack of permission in contract D. I would like to roll back the changes made in the previous contracts, but as I understand it that would also take gas right? But from what I understand, if I run out of gas at some point, the logic just stops at the point where there was no more gas. 

So potentially it could stop mid change reversal in contractB and leave the changes in contract A inTact (pun semi-intended). 

How is stuff like this handled? Should the user just be sending enough gas to cover all potential routes of logic?

Text: Hi everyone,

I need some advice. I'm learning Tact and trying to build a smart contract that can accept USDT from one address, hold it for a while, and then send it to another address. I know how to send TON, but I'm not sure how to send USDT on the TON blockchain.

I found USDT Asset Processing on TON, but I'm still confused. Can someone explain the steps I need to take and where to look for information? Is it possible to do this with just Tact?

The goal is for a user to log in with TON Connect, send USDT to another user (who also connects with TON Connect), and after some time, the sender sends another transaction to release the funds to the receiver.

Thanks for your help!

Text: No. These are different types. 

Cell/slice is like a "train" of data having been put in order, one piece after another. (And of course, with at most 4 references to other cells.)

But struct is like a "vector" with multiple dimensions.

Text: Hey guys!
Maybe someone here can give me a clue =)
My team is developing a Traction Eye service where a user can analyse not only tokens but also the DeFi protocols he uses.

We have a technical question from the backend side:
1)Is it possible to get the data of protocols used by a particular wallet: 
- Liquid pools (Dedust, StonFi)
- Lending protocol (EVAA) 
- Staking providers (Bemo, Stakers, Stakee, etc).
How can this be implemented?
To make it clearer what data we are talking about, you can see the mockup.

Text: I would suggest refactoring your architecture. And be cautious about your contract being drained if it can be forced to spend money. To calculate gas on map traversal, you can try to locate this code in compiled fift file (in build difectory), look up TVM instructions gas prices and estimate the cost by multiplying it on length of your map (or log of length).

Text: For one thing: 
From experience, I've found that sometimes explorers and scanners have difficulties finding those NFT items. For example, I minted an NFT item on GetGems and then made it "hidden". Now, when I explore my wallet using TonViewer, I can see the NFT under the "Collectibles" tab with no problem. However, when I switch to TonScan, it cannot be found under the "NFTs" tab, though one can still find it by tracing the transaction history of the wallet.

Text: The address of your wallet is derived from your public key and the wallet's code. It means that if you change your wallet's code, you will have it deployed under a different address.

This can be illustrated using the following equation: public key + code = wallet address

Hence

public key + code v3r2 = wallet address v3r2 

public key + code v3r3 = wallet address v3r3

Therefore, when you change your wallet version, you change your wallet's code and hence have your NFT deployed to a completely different address!

Well, you may try to brute-force all possible combinations of what the original message could look like and see if the decoded data makes any sense. But I don't think that you're interested in decoding a single BoC.  

Therefore the answer is that there is no way to decode BoC without its TL-B. Please feel free to correct me if my reasoning is somewhere wrong.

Text: üöÄ Tact v1.3 release notes

The new Tact v1.3 release provides a massive improvement on the smart contract programming for TON blockchain.

üó∫ Maps

Traversing a map has never been easier! The foreach loop for the Map type:

let mapLength: Int = 0;
foreach (k, v in map) {
  mapLength += 1;
}


You don't have to use map.set(key, null) to remove a key from your maps, use the more intuitive del method instead: map.del(key).

Want to check if the map is empty? Use map.isEmpty()!

üî§ Strings 

Strings finally support escape sequences, like \\, \", \n, \u0000 through \uFFFF, etc.

There is a new non-modifying StringBuilder's concat method for chained string concatenations: b = b.concat("Hello,").concat(foo).concat("Tact!").

We added the toString method for the Address type that you asked for numerous times in the dev chats: address("EQBKgXCNLPexWhs2L79kiARR1phGH1LwXxRbNsCFF9doc2lN").toString().

üëå Handling exceptions

Want to process various TVM and user-defined exit codes before your contract fails at runtime? The try and try-catch statements: https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/statements#try-catch:


try {
    let foo: Int = 42 / 0;
} catch(e) {
    // your division by zero handler
}


‚òÄÔ∏è New quality-of-life improving syntax

Tact started supporting struct fields punning, i.e. {foo, bar} is syntactic sugar for { foo: foo, bar: bar }.

There is support for trailing commas in all comma-separated lists in Tact, here is how you can use it with structs:
  
  foo(Struct {
    field1: 42,
    field2: "42",
  })
  

You can now chain method calls with the unboxing operator !!, e.g. map.asCell()!!.hash().

For those missing some bit-level hackery, there is the bitwise XOR operator ^ available now.

‚öôÔ∏è Stdlib enhancements 

The Tact team has added log2 and log, pow2 and pow functions.

Use reserve mode constants from @stdlib/reserve instead of their numeric values to make your code even easier to read: https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-advanced#nativereserve-base-modes.

üß† Debugging

Debugging has become easier now as the dump() and dumpStack() functions now print the file path, line number, and column number in addition to the data specified by the programmer.

Addresses can be arguments of the dump function.

üíª Tact CLI

Tact's command line interface just became a lot more user-friendly: run npx tact --help from terminal and see what's available.

Just a highlight: CLI now allows compiling a single Tact file directly, without specifying a config file: npx tact your-awesome-contract.tact. It's very useful for quick experiments or bug reports.

üõ† Third-party tools support 

For third-party tools implementors there is new improved APIs: AST traversals, access to the AST store of top-level items like functions, constants, traits, etc.

Happy hacking! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Check out Tact's CHANGELOG for the comprehensive list of features, changes and bugfixes.

Check out the Tact docs and read about the new Tact features.

To upgrade your Blueprint-based Tact projects to use Tact v1.3.1, run npm upgrade inside the project folder.

This release was brought to you by 0kenx, byakuren-hijiri, Max Korsunov, Novus Nota, Vitor Py, Daniil Sedov, and Anton Trunov.

Text: there is no easy solution because the jetton wallet address is derived  from (jetton_master + holder)

to notify everyone you either need to have a huge map (which is strongly not recommended and is a very bad idea as it doesn't scale)

but this can be a good idea if you have up  to 250 elements, I guess, I still try to figure out how gas is calculated for mappings

you can also try to create something like 'channel' contract which deploys subscriptions from (channel address + subscription id = 0) but deriving address costs ~0.005 TON for single contract + transfer 0.005 approximately

so to message 1000 holders it will cost 10 tons

there easiest way is to make jetton holders claim their tokens by themselves, so you create such contract and then other people just send a message to claim their tokens

Your init must take your public key, in this way, it's derived using your mnemonics. Then you can modify the deploy receiver and provide initial values for your init. 

Your current contract address is derived from some initial value you provide (your data) and the code of your contract. There is no link to you public key and, therefore, your mnemonics

Text: I don't think I have some code for Tact, but the idea behind is the same as for wallet contracts.

This is the simplest wallet on TON (V1)

https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/wallet-code.fc

You can see that on the line 13, the public key is loaded from get data with seqno.

It's stored with contract init 

So you can add init(publicKey: slice) 

Then you can modify the deploy message so it sends the correct initial value for your contract.

Deploy { queryId, value }

You will need to remove Deployable trait

Then you receive deploy message, init everything completely, and then just do self.notify DeployOk

I hope you manage implement this. If you struggle, I can help you with the code later today

Text: No, I disagree. I would say that with some syntax similarities like Ruby, it is a little easier than C.

It also has good enough optimizations. For more optimizations you can use Fift inside FunC, like writiing Assembly inside C. 

The hard part is learning TVM.
Reply to: I think FunC is a lot more low level than C

These optimization that you talk about, might only matter in competition between differet protocols. 

And in that case, you still have options.

Text: "Ken M" said that it would be good that compiler optimizes code in such a way that small changes are automatically applied to improve gas usage.

This makes the generated code somehow unpredictable. After all, another "improved" code is generated and placed there, and I as a developer/reader/auditor cannot easily guess what Fift (assembly) code is generated behind the scenes.

Reply to: I've also heard somewhat about local fee markets on the TON blockchain. Does it mean that if I will be sending lots of messages to a specific contract, the gas price for this contract will go up? Or am I mistaking this from other blockchains?

But if you have some 7 interactions in between and got bounced due to some other reasons, at that time whatever that was passed as value(gas) will get stucked in the immediate caller right, it wil not be given back to the user who initiated it. Right

So the user will loose the extra TON. 
Is there something that can be done , so users wont loose the extra TON?

Text: Hi everyone,
I've a trouble when get Jetton contract wallet address inside the smart contract.
I'm using the Jetton contract from this source: https://tact-by-example.org/07-jetton-standard, and I'm trying to get the Jetton wallet address from my contract. Here are the details:

In my contract, I get the wallet address with this code:


let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(msg.jettonAddress, myAddress());
let contractWallet: Address = contractAddress(init);
dump("Master: ");
dump(msg.jettonAddress);
dump("Owner: ");
dump(myAddress());
dump("contractWallet: ");
dump(contractWallet);

However, when I read the data from the Jetton address, I get a different contract wallet, even though I use the same input for Master and Owner addresses:


virtual fun getJettonWalletInit(address: Address): StateInit {
    let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), address);
    let contractWallet: Address = contractAddress(init);
    dump("Master: ");
    dump(myAddress());
    dump("Owner: ");
    dump(address);
    dump("contractWallet: ");
    dump(contractWallet);

    return initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), address);
}


You can find more details and reproduce the issue by running the tests here: https://github.com/quocle108/ton-tact-test. Below is the test debug output:

Reply to: Hey guys,
somehow my initOf JettonDefaultWallet returns a different address inside the contract and my test. Anyone knows the reason for that? I didnt found any solutions in the messages before. I only found people having the same issue.

Reply to: Hi everyone. 
This is a question, maybe you know the reason for this awkward situation.

Im trying to create contract, which  must manage jettons on JettonDefaultWallet. I use the default JettonDefaultWallet and JettonMaster.

But in the contract it gives a different result than when I ask JettonMastera for the JettonVolet address at the my contract address. I thought this was in a test environment. But it‚Äôs the same on the testnet. And everything seems to be according 
to the manual.


let init: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), self.jetton_master);
        let wallet_address: Address = contractAddress(init);


Func:


((slice, slice, slice, int, slice, slice, (int, int), int, int, slice), ()) $JobOffer$_fun_send_deposit((slice, slice, slice, int, slice, slice, (int, int), int, int, slice) $self, slice $address, int $amount) impure inline_ref {
    var (($self'order, $self'title, $self'description, $self'price, $self'owner, $self'doer, ($self'job_state'doer, $self'job_state'owner), $self'state, $self'is_locked, $self'jetton_master)) = $self;
    var ($ctx'bounced, $ctx'sender, $ctx'value, $ctx'raw) = __tact_context_get();
    var ($init'code, $init'data) = $JettonDefaultWallet$_init_child(__tact_context_sys, my_address(), $self'jetton_master);
    slice $to = $global_contractAddress(($init'code, $init'data));
    $global_send($SendParameters$_constructor_to_value_mode_body_data_code($to, 0, (64 | 2), $TokenTransfer$_store_cell($TokenTransfer$_constructor_query_id_amount_sender_response_destination_custom_payload_forward_ton_amount_forward_payload(0, $amount, my_address(), $address, end_cell(begin_cell()), 100000000, $Cell$_fun_asSlice(end_cell(begin_cell())))), $init'data, $init'code));
    return (($self'order, $self'title, $self'description, $self'price, $self'owner, $self'doer, ($self'job_state'doer, $self'job_state'owner), $self'state, $self'is_locked, $self'jetton_master), ());
}



And it turns out that the only way out is to transfer the init + data code for the flight token manually after deployment. But this is kind of an ugly solution. Perhaps you know what the problem is in the story now.


Thank you

Text: You probably import contract wrapper from another dir.
When we write contracts in Tact, when compiled, they are linked to the code of the contracts that we use.
If you use this approach, then you need to import contracts from the same compiled folder.
But if you want to use token contracts without being tied to the token code, and for example use jUSDT tokens, you can consider requesting the token address from the master contract in your contract. I did it like this:




send(SendParameters{
            to: self.jetton_master, // sending message back to the sender
            value: simple_message_request, 
            body: ProvideWalletAddress{
                query_id: 0,
                owner_address: myAddress(),
                include_address: false,
            }.toCell(),
        });


And do receiver like this:


receive(msg: TakeWalletAddress) {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        if (ctx.sender == self.jetton_master) {
            self.jetton_wallet = msg.wallet_address;
    }

Text: There are different stages when executing contracts with TVM.

Some of them are the compute phase and the action phase.

In your code, when it's executed, it's in the compute phase. The action of sending a message is recorded in the c5 register containing actions. Then you delete something from the contract dictionary and decrement its length.

The action itself is sent after the compute phase, hence it's sent after you update your storage.

However, if you will be sending 2 messages where each message has the mode SendRemainingBalance, then the first message will send all the remaining balance and the second one will just send 0 (because you have already decided to send all the remaining balance with the first message)

It should not work as you describe, to my knowledge. That's because you compute what to send when your dictionary still has data that you delete later. The action is sent later, but what to send is calculated before you delete the data.

Text: I have contract called Broker

If you build your contract and then explore its code, you can find the following:

slice $broker = $global_contractAddress(($brokerStateInit'code, $brokerStateInit'data));

this is what contractAddress compiles for.

initOf is compiled into:

var ($brokerStateInit'code, $brokerStateInit'data) = $Broker$_init_child(__tact_context_sys, my_address(), $response'stream);

If you would like to join me on this journey, please let me know.  I don't want to advertise here.

therefore, when receiving the notification, you agree to pay for it using your own contract balance

by default, the gas limit is incoming message value / gas price

0.005 should be enough for the average transaction + call accept_message

  ... n_expiration_type_investment_payout(slice holder, slice writer, int initiation, int expiration, int type, int investment, int payout) inline;

Does it mean that type is a reserved word in Tact?

I've built a contract that accepts the Agreement struct with the type field. It works fine in the testnet. 

But now I'm trying to instantiate an object of that struct in the contract and I'm simply getting pissed off by the compiler.

UPD. I've just refactored all my code that there's no type field anymore. As a result, I have no errors.

If that's a reserved word, then cool, but we need to make sure that the user is not limited inside structs, or, at least show this error earlier, when the first compilation takes place. I've also never seen any type parameter in FunC. Is it some extra from Tact?

Text: Welcome, Rashid!

It's difficult to answer your question because it contains 'is going to be'. I'm sure it will substitute FunC completely one day. But it's yet to happen. For building proofs of concept, it's already great. My development time decreased a lot (I reckon it increased at least 4 times). I would spend like 2 months rather than 2 weeks on what I have built now. If you need to use FunC, you can simply call FunC code from Tact using native functions. Therefore, the answer to your question depends on what you want to build. If something is 0-to-1 and maybe beyond, Tact is already preferred. If you require aggressive optimizations and complex engineering, then I would prefer FunC today, but, as Tact gets better, I will switch to Tact.

Well, now, I will address the next question. As of now, Tact compiles directly into FunC. Therefore, if FunC can do something, you can do it Tact. You may even write some custom code in FunC and call it from Tact üëÄ As long as Tact is compliable into FunC, you will have no trouble. But in the future, Tact is going to be compiled directly into Fift (that's the language for manipulating the TVM stack like the Forth programming language). I think, once this milestone is achieved, the developers of Tact will make sure that Tact can do the same spectre of tasks as FunC.

Text: Yes, exactly. I've written a custom logger (shrek-logger)

It's inside utils.ts at the nenuma repository.

It shows the exit code as a number. If I get some errors, I then just go to the code and can precisely track what's the problem.

If I have a hashed string, that's quite not intuitive.

I create constants that represent error codes so that it's also easy for me to navigate around the code.

However, it also adds lots of boilerplate. Unfortunately, there's no way to export constants yet (or I just haven't found them in the exports).

Reply to: Yes, exactly. I've written a custom logger (shrek-logger)

It's inside utils.ts at the nenuma repository.

It shows the exit code as a number. If I get some errors, I then just go to the code and can precisely track what's the problem.

If I have a hashed string, that's quite not intuitive.

I create constants that represent error codes so that it's also easy for me to navigate around the code.

However, it also adds lots of boilerplate. Unfortunately, there's no way to export constants yet (or I just haven't found them in the exports).

Text: The answer to your question very much depends on the length of your string.

Fift (the language for manipulating the TVM stack; Tact compiles into FunC and Func compiles into Fift) uses UFT-8 for strings. It means that each character can be 8 bits (1 byte), 16 bits (2 bytes), 24 bits (3 bytes), or 32 bits (4 bytes). Chinese characters require more than 1 byte to store.

Therefore, a string 'Hello, World!' takes 13 bytes or 13 * 8 = 104 bits. That's how much storage you need. 

The function sha256 in Tact calls the SHA256U opcode under the hood. It returns a 256-bit unsigned integer x.

https://docs.ton.org/learn/tvm-instructions/instructions#:~:text=F902-,SHA256U,-s%20%2D%20x

Therefore, if your string size is <= 256 bits, that's reasonable to store the value as a string. But, if it's longer than that, it's better to use sha256 as you only need to check if the strings match. Obviously, you won't be able to restore the original value from such a hash.

I have to double-check that you pay fees just for the bits you use or for the number of cells you use. Could anyone elaborate on that and supply a relevant link to the documentation?

If you pay just for the number of bits you use, then the limits are the same as I described above. If you pay for the number of cells, then it's reasonable to use sha256 if you have a string that takes more then 1023 bits.

I have a great example of how to calculate fees for transferring and burning jettons.

That's the source code of the USDT contract on the TON Blockchain. You can write such functions in FunC and then bridge them into Tact.

There is contract A and a user 1.
The user 1 makes a transaction to contract A and which makes further transcations in response. 
Here is the txn flow:

Text: i don't see how you add/subtract stakes tokens; based on this code, you just record the amount transfered (that's doesn't sound like staking)

one possibility is that you don't have enough gas coming with you notification to execute your complex hendler

try logging the contract in the tests with with https://www.npmjs.com/package/@henchtab/shrek

it will show you -14 exit code if you try to send jetton in your tests with specifying the sender


There're 2 options you can do;

the first one is to set higher forward_ton_amount

that's the value in toncoins that comes with your notification


the second one is to call nativeAcceptMessage(); you have to write a binding from FunC's stdlib for this one,

if you call this function after authorizing that the sender is the right contract, then your contract will pay for this transfer from its balance

Text: Package is possibly null

You cannot access any properties on the null object 

You need to explicitly state that the value is not null

Try package!!.endTime

But make sure it's not null

The type for endTime is also just Int; it's not defined as maybe null in your struct

Text: Yes, that's like a library that has features that I didn't find in the @ton/test-utils, but I found them very useful when developing smart contracts for Nenuma. 

There is a function in @ton/test-utils called something like printTransactionFees and it was so confusing. It was a nightmare debugging contracts with it. 

I saw lots of random fees and now idea what transaction action is failing, where this message is, etc.

I was once debugging a set of transactions that was causing 13 actions. One of my transactions was bouncing as I hadn't attached enough value to pay for the gas fees.

I spent a few hours writing expects and then just gave up and implemented a function called printTransactions. It was printing simplified fees and was showing me sources and destinations of my actions.

Then I realized that it would be good to have some labels and log contract balances from time to time. That's how I created a logger.

There's a feature in the sandbox that the first transaction was like an external transaction that brings some value. It didn't have source address and values could be null sometimes.

I was rewatching Shrek with my friend that day so I just started generating some funny ogre-style info in my console.

That's pretty much who the Shrek was born :))

Text: I'm currently exploring how to set up a local environment like Hardhat:

https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview

The console logger is great, but imagine if we had a graphical interface like Tonviewer that shows action flows with dynamic charts. That would be a game-changer for TON development.

Unlike other blockchains, where you don't have to track tons of transactions, TON's async nature makes it super easy to get lost. Plus, architecting contracts to be scalable, like Jetton wallets or NFTs, is really tough to debug.

Although it's available on the testnet already, it's not ready for production yet.  I'm planning to launch it by the end of Q3 if everything goes well

Text: HI there! Is any one know why contract address is different if I'm trying get this adres directly from my contract and if I'm getting that address from jetton standard method

There are examples:

contract = await MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address);

contract.address == jetton.getGetWalletAddress(gamer.address); ---> FALSE 

But code for getGetWalletAddress is the same like

    get fun get_wallet_address(owner_address: Address): Address {
        let init: StateInit = initOf MyWallet(owner_address, myAddress());
        dump(contractAddress(init));
        dump(owner_address);
        dump(myAddress());
        return contractAddress(init);
    }

so all values are correct owner_address and myAddress() in contract the same as in MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address) but always contractAddress(init) not equal  await MyWallet.fromInit(gamer.address, jetton.address).address

Thanks!

Text: so basically you derive addresses differently

you derive address for master from just owner address

we can note this as the following: hash(owner_address) -> master_address

but for item you derive the address like hash(owner_address, master_address) -> item_address

as you see, you provide different arguments when calculating the address of the contract; that's why addresses are different

Text: if you want to get the same address using the getter function, then you need to store this addresses somewhere

the most straightforward solution is to put a getter for Item inside the Master

like using self.owner field

like get fun master() -> return myAddress() and get fun item() -> return initOf Item(self.owner, myAddress())

In both examples is the same initial addresses for  initOf Item - the values are the equal

Thank you @pantemon!
Reply to: so basically you derive addresses differently

you derive address for master from just owner address

we can note this as the following: hash(owner_address) -> master_address

but for item you derive the address like hash(owner_address, master_address) -> item_address

as you see, you provide different arguments when calculating the address of the contract; that's why addresses are different

i have no problem as you described

i've also tried to clone the repo of the author of the issue, and this repo simply didn't compile ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

can u upload you code on github and share? 'cause i don't see how it can be wrong

btw calling like initOf inside the contract itself is a bit unusual

https://github.com/pantemon/laughing-octo-chainsaw/blob/main/contracts/master.tact#L13

what's the use case?

in this design, i would simply use myAddress()

it may be the reason why you got different addresses as tact < v1.4.0 may had the issue compiling such code

In both examples is the same initial addresses for  initOf Item - the values are the equal

Text: you can use hashed user secrets as random seed:
1. Starting pre-game
2. Users pay for participation
3. Users create own secrets.
4. Users hash it and send this hash in the game contract.
5. You stop pre-game. Users can enter the game no more.
6. Game starts.
7. Timelocked contract wait for players to reveal their secrets.
8. When the time ran out one can end the game. The random seed is hash of users' secrets.


If participation is too cheap one can create lots of fake players and reveal their secret only if it makes him win. You can make people pay a big fee on secret sending and repay a part of it on secret reveal

Reply to: what's the version of  tact-compiler you're using?

i've just built a demo using you code and run the tests using tact-lang/compiler v1.4.0

https://github.com/pantemon/laughing-octo-chainsaw.git

i have no problem as you described

i've also tried to clone the repo of the author of the issue, and this repo simply didn't compile ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

can u upload you code on github and share? 'cause i don't see how it can be wrong

btw calling like initOf inside the contract itself is a bit unusual

https://github.com/pantemon/laughing-octo-chainsaw/blob/main/contracts/master.tact#L13

what's the use case?

in this design, i would simply use myAddress()

it may be the reason why you got different addresses as tact < v1.4.0 may had the issue compiling such code

Text: let's define 'usual' and 'unusual'

'usual' is when you implement master-slave (or as it's also called parent-child) pattern

e.g., you have a collection, the collection deploys NFT items;

i consider that as usual as i've always worked with such code in FunC and hence now working in Tact

'unusual' this is when Todo deploys Todo, as in your example; that's when you call initOf inside the contract itself

if you're building a referral system which has a structure similar to the linked list, then yes, that's a great pattern, but I never used it on TON 

btw that's an interesting task to do in FunC 'cause i literally haven't seen anyone doing that


i'm not involved with building tact compiler; if the question is to fix the problem, then just use 'usual' master-slave pattern

if the question is too figure out what is theoretically possible to do and the goal is not to fix staff, but to explore, then i'm likely to be not the best guide as i'm not involved with tact compilor development; i'm just a developer who tries to help others with building their web3 products

i've just tried to solve the problem ignoring that the question is like 'what theoretically i can achieve'

i'm very keen to see what this issues ends up with

Storing large amounts of data on the blockchain is no good.

You need to off-chain data that you don't really need or use ton storage.

If u want to subsidize transactions for your users, then you need to implement something like Tonkeeper Battery but which funds only interactions with your smart contracts

you can sub your address into these util to see how different addresses behave

if you want a testnet address, then you can convert it into any other by changing the prefix. i.e., the first letter (so if you want a bouncable testnet then you need the first letter to be k) and also you need to change the postfix, i.e., the last 4 letters (i.e. change them for IslI if you're doing bounceable testnet)

Reply to: If so, the longer a smart contract is deployed and the more data it has, the higher its fee will be. Imagine an nft or a token whose fees increase over time: first year fee transfer is 0.1 ton, second year fee tranfer 0. 2 ton,  ten years  5 ton üòÖ while value of nft is 0.1 ton

Have a look at this. That's a comprehensive guide.

You must avoid storing your NFTs in the hashmap. The fees for hashmaps depend on the number of elements you store. That's unpredictable.

You need to use native functions

https://github.com/henchtab/nenuma/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/subscriber.tact#L3

This is an example of how I used accept_message

The idea is that accept_message is inside the stdlib.fc and we create a binding to this function in the stdlib.fc

I have to check if there's a function for ECRECOVER

If there's no such function, then simply add by expanding the stdlib

Trying to deploy a contract, so that it sends a message to another contract inside of init() function.

Nevertheless, while testing, there is no outgoing messages ,except of the gas exccess sent to deployer

Text: You can use TreasuryContract to send Jettons and test transactions.

Have a look at 

https://github.com/henchtab/nenuma/blob/main/packages/contracts/tests/Broker.spec.ts#L52

If you specifically want to deploy a wallet, you will need to have a wrapper to interact with such a wallet. 

Have a look at how tests are done for the new wallet W5 

https://github.com/tonkeeper/w5/tree/main/tests

You can use w5 in your tests as well if u want, but I don't see much point unless you deliberately test batch transactions

Reply to: the methods marked as get are just viewable and can not change the contract states and can call from  your contract or outside of contract
but if you want to change the contract's states you should use non-get functions and call them in a wrapper function by a receiver or directly in a receiver block
actually if you are come from solidity, get methods are like view in solidity

I am checking this example, and see that dump() execution requires a lot of gas 
Gas: 0.070887

While whole contract deploy needs 
Gas: 0.008681

I checked func generated, looks dump is removed from there, changed to __tact_nop();

So this is just the way emulator counts gas, in real net it will be zero?

I also have another one problem, if use .get() on a map with key as Address it doesn't want to work properly in tests with this message:  Unable to execute get method. Got exit_code: 7, but with Ints it works great.

Here is my headache:

Text: The answer is it depends. If the message you're sending is like sum numbers a and b, then such a transaction is pretty much deterministic. It means you can actually quite well predict the fees. But if you have something that involves a loop inside, then the number of iterations and, as a result, the gas depends a lot on the actual value. You could have run a simulation, but since TON is async, that's inefficient and rather expansive. It's recommended to use a 'carry pattern' which carries all the value along the transaction to make sure that all fees are paid and then the excessive funds are returned back to someone. Take a look at TEP-74. There's a response_destination address. It will receive all the excessive funds from the transaction.

Text: ‚ö°Ô∏è Added Mermaid diagrams of trait inheritance and contract dependencies to the compilation report

Did you know, that Tact produces a report of each compilation in a markdown format? If not, take a quick look at what it offers:

‚Ä¢ Resulting BoC size of the contract in bytes
‚Ä¢ TL-B schemes of all Structs and Messages alongside with their Tact signatures
‚Ä¢ List of all getter functions
‚Ä¢ List of exit codes, both default and produced by calls to require()

And now, Tact also automatically generates neat Mermaid diagrams of trait inheritance and contract dependencies, and puts them in that .md file! Check your build folders once in a while, it's definitely worth it.

üßë‚Äçüç≥ Contributor: Gusarich

Text: Hi Everyone, I have a doubt regarding Validation of Signed BOC in the Backend, I am following this article as reference,
https://medium.com/coinmonks/understanding-ton-transactions-how-to-track-transaction-results-and-utilize-tonclient-b992336eb3a3
Here, they are getting the signed BOC from the frontend, How can I get the signed BOC in the backend as the functionality we have will initiate transactions on the backend level. Can anyone please clarify this doubt
const openedWallet = client.open(wallet);
    const seqNo = await openedWallet.getSeqno();
    const message = internal({
      to:toAddress,
      value: toNano("0.01"),
      body: beginCell().storeUint(0, 32).endCell(),
      bounce: false,
    });

    const transfer = openedWallet.createTransfer({
      secretKey: key.secretKey,
      seqno: seqNo,
      messages: [message],
    });

    const signedBOC = transfer.toBoc().toString("base64");
    const hash = transfer.hash().toString("base64");
    console.log("Signed BOC:", signedBOC);
This is what I have tried but validation is not working properly, the validation code is the following

const transaction = await this.WaitForTransaction({
      hash,
      walletAddress: openedWallet.address,
      refetchInterval: 2000,
      refetchLimit: 10,
    });
    console.log(transaction);
public static WaitForTransaction = async (options: WaitForTransactionOptions): Promise<Transaction | null> => {
    const { hash, refetchInterval = 1000, refetchLimit, walletAddress } = options;
    const client = await TonClientService.GetTonClient();
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      let refetches = 0;
      const interval = setInterval(handleTransactionCheck, refetchInterval);
      async function handleTransactionCheck() {
        refetches += 1;
        console.log("waiting transaction...");
        const state = await client.getContractState(walletAddress);
        if (!state || !state.lastTransaction) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          resolve(null);
          return;
        }
        console.log("last transaction available");
        const lastLt = state.lastTransaction.lt;
        const lastHash = state.lastTransaction.hash;
        const lastTx = await client.getTransaction(walletAddress, lastLt, lastHash);

        if (lastTx && lastTx.inMessage) {
          const msgCell = beginCell().store(storeMessage(lastTx.inMessage)).endCell();

          const inMsgHash = msgCell.hash().toString("base64");
          console.log("InMsgHash", inMsgHash);
          console.log("Hash", hash);
          if (inMsgHash === hash) {
            clearInterval(interval);
            resolve(lastTx);
          }
        }
        if (refetchLimit && refetches >= refetchLimit) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          resolve(null);
        }
      }
    });
  };

Reply to: In my case I have the following message with the same code 0x7362d09c:

message(0x7362d09c) TokenNotification {
    query_id: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as coins;
    from: Address; 
    forward_payload: Slice as remaining;
}

And here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm trying to handle an incoming transfer:

receive(msg: TokenNotification) {
    emit("Tokens transferred!".asComment());
}

Am I getting this right?

Btw, the implementation from your link has a bit different parameter name, instead of from: Address it has sender: Address. I‚Äôm using the implementation from tact-by-example

Self.reply and sending balance in sendRemainingValue mode in transactions only send the TON amount that is remaining from the transaction Fees is what I read.

But when I use them in my contract, a little amount of TON from my contract is getting deducted. So at some point will my contract be depleted of all TON.

                }.toCell(),
            });


    }

 
I wanted to send 100 jettons to the address of the winner in my lottery

then I ran the script. The lottery winner was selected but the tokens were not sent to him.

const sendParams = {
        value: toNano('0.1'), 
        bounce: false 
    };


    await lotteryJtl.send(
        owner, { 
            value: sendParams.value, 
        }, 
         'Finish'
    );

 how can I solve this problem, please help me üôè

Text: I‚Äôm trying to generate an address of a contract‚Äôs jetton wallet. Is this the right way to do it?

let JettonInitCode: StateInit = initOf TheJetton(self.admin, TheJettonInfo.toCell(), ton("1000000000"));

let TheJettonWalletInit: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(self.admin, contractAddress(JettonInitCode));

let TheJettonWalletAddress: Address = contractAddress(TheJettonWalletInit);
Reply to: My contract dynamically mints these jettons. How do I obtain the jetton wallet address for the jetton upon its initiation?

Here‚Äôs how I mint them:
receive("InitJettons") {
        let theInitCode: StateInit = initOf TheJetton(‚Ä¶);
        
        self.theJetton = theInitCode;
        
        send(SendParameters{ ‚Ä¶  });

        // How do I obtain the jetton wallet address for the contract here?
}

And here‚Äôs how I handle the incoming transfers of the same jettons in the same contract:
receive(msg: TokenNotification) {
        let jettonWalletAddress: Address = context().sender;
        
        // Here I want to ensure that the received jettons == TheJetton that we‚Äôve created above

To do this, I have built a Jetton, but 5% commission is applied to all transaction including users transfer, not only transaction from Dex.
so I thought to ignore users transfer by adding "if" statement passing only pucharge/sell from Dex.
however, to add "if" statement, I have to know already added Dex pool address. but how can I add liquidity using my Jetton don't deployed yet?

I wanted to send 100 jettons to the address of the winner in my lottery

then I ran the script. The lottery winner was selected but the tokens were not sent to him.

const sendParams = {
        value: toNano('0.1'), 
        bounce: false 
    };


    await lotteryJtl.send(
        owner, { 
            value: sendParams.value, 
        }, 
         'Finish'
    );

 how can I solve this problem, please help me üôè

I deployed it and then sent a little TON (for commissions) and my token to it, when I call "Jetton", this error comes out (in the screenshot). I have already made dozens of attempts with different code, but the tokens are not being sent. Help please

Is this the right way to get the contract‚Äôs wallet address for USDT?


self.USDT_MASTER_ADDRESS = address("EQBxyk‚Ä¶‚Äù);

let USDTWalletInit: StateInit = initOf JettonDefaultWallet(myAddress(), self.USDT_MASTER_ADDRESS);

Yes, you can implement the transfer method with your customize name 

But the transfer message should have correct identifier 


I hope this example be helpful for you üòé

Text: I think it depends on your task, but I guess no. In TON, it is common to deploy smart contracts on each user just to keep bool variable. If your messages have an expire time, you maybe can keep a hashmap inside one contract and clean it of expired messages, but be aware that the gas cost of hashmap operations increases with it's size and you can stuck with gas limit

- also, you can get in touch with us (the Tact team) and we might as well support your use case in the compiler if it will benefit the whole community in the long run

Text: Hi, I have a design question regarding sharding.  Does it make sense to have a parent contract that deploys all child contracts and maintains a map of their addresses. In such a scheme, all requests are received by the parent contract and routed to the respective child contract. The parent remains relatively 'thin' but still holds a map. Or, should the parent deploy the child contract, and then have the users interact directly with the child contract? In this scheme the parent contract acts pretty much as a deployer and is very thin in the sense that no map is required. What are some pros and cons of each from your experience? Thanks in advance

From: Tonion Dev
Text: Hi Nerses
when you try to send the token to someone else, the Jetton master contract computes the init.data and init.code and sends a Tx, if the receiver wallet has an instance of that Jetton wallet, it will receive the tokens and his balance will increment, otherwise, a new Jetton wallet will deploy for receiver and then the transferred token amount will be added to the receiver Jetton Wallet

you can find a sample of a function that calculates the init in Tonion 

abstraction:
https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/57e84a223798db5a43ffe57250baa0928a288ff2/contracts/traits/tokens/jetton/JettonMaster.tact#L36

and the test case for transfer Jetton:

maybe this function will be helpful for you
this function creates on-chain metadata and returns Cell type

maybe reversing this function logic from Tonion can help you :

Text: thanks a lot.for detailed and very good explanation
Reply to: Hi Nerses
when you try to send the token to someone else, the Jetton master contract computes the init.data and init.code and sends a Tx, if the receiver wallet has an instance of that Jetton wallet, it will receive the tokens and his balance will increment, otherwise, a new Jetton wallet will deploy for receiver and then the transferred token amount will be added to the receiver Jetton Wallet

you can find a sample of a function that calculates the init in Tonion 

abstraction:
https://github.com/ton-ion/tonion-contracts/blob/57e84a223798db5a43ffe57250baa0928a288ff2/contracts/traits/tokens/jetton/JettonMaster.tact#L36

implementation:

and the test case for transfer Jetton:

I deployed it and then sent a little TON (for commissions) and my token to it, when I call "Jetton", this error comes out (in the screenshot). I have already made dozens of attempts with different code, but the tokens are not being sent. Help please

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on! We've developed a new protocol called PreHTLC, an evolution of the traditional HTLC (Hash Time-Locked Contract) designed for crypto asset transfers. This protocol aims to facilitate truly permissionless and trustless cross-chain asset transactions.

We're providing a user-friendly UI along with the necessary links and access to our GitHub repository for those interested in diving into the code or providing feedback.

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!

I'd like to know what can I use for hashing in Tact? All I found is workaround with Cell.hash, so first I need to build a cell with data I want to hash, but it seems strange for me, is it OK?

Text: overflow happens because you store "payload" in the same cell as the main part of the TokenTransfer

to fix this (and also to fix the underflow that occurs for you in real network) change your payload construction to this:

let payload = beginCell().storeBit(true).storeRef(StonfiSwap{

Text: this code throws error cell umderflow   receive(msg: TokenNotification){
        let op_code: Int = msg.forward_payload.preloadUint(32);
        if (op_code == 1734998782){

    }

 although first line works correctly  without any error. What can cause that ?

Text: hey @novusnota42 i wasn't able to find a comparison or something similar, but as of now, is Tact feature-complete for smart contract development on TON? like, is there anything that you wouldn't be able to do with Tact rn that you can with FunC, other than low level stuff?

i was also wondering if Tact let's you drop down to FunC or Fift, similar to how Solidity let's you drop down to Yul when you need low-level stuff

Reply to: Hello everyone, is it possible to return two values from a function in Tact?

fun getLevelInfo(levelID: Int): Slice{
        levelID -= 1;
        require(levelID < self.levelsLength, "!levelID");
        let level: Int = levelID % 2;
        let round: Int = (levelID - level) / 2;
        let res: Cell = beginCell().storeUint(level, 4).storeUint(round, 4).endCell();
        return res.asSlice();
    }

Text: in case the data is encapsulted  inside variable in this way beginCell().storeUint(1, 1).storeRef(beginCell().storeUint(1734998782, 32).storeBuilder(b_0).endCell()).endCell();   and send it as field in message will this be correct way to read the data ?           let op_code: Int = mainMsg.loadUint(32);
        let b_0: Slice = mainMsg.loadRef().asSlice();

  here mainMsg is the value of sent data

I'm reaching out today to seek feedback on a smart contract I've been working on. It's Nft contracts which allows only whitelisted users mint NFTs. it is managed by a WhitelistManager on which owners add users to whitelist it deploy new contract that stores users whitelist info. That contract can be call by the whitelist user. User call "mintNFT" to mint nft from two contracts Cards and Pets

I've posted the code on GitHub Gist: https://gist.github.com/nxved/217b473ba275ddfe582b4ad0a225ea01

I'm particularly interested in getting your insights on:

Security: Are there any potential vulnerabilities or exploits in the contract?
Functionality: Does the code achieve the intended functionality as expected?
Efficiency: Can the code be optimized for better gas usage or performance?
Best Practices: Are there any coding practices or standards I should be following that I've missed?
Any feedback or suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to learning and improving the contract, so please don't hesitate to point out any areas that could be better.

Text: Hello everyone, how to implement the following logic: The user sends a message to the smart contract address "Parent" and 5 tons, upon receipt of this message, the Parent deposits the Child and 5 tons remains at the Parent's address. But if the user sends the same message again with 5 tons, then how do I send these tons back to him? When sending a message from a Parent to a Child, I check the parameter in the Child contract and if it is not equal to 0, then I need to roll back the entire transaction and return the user his coins minus the commission?

If you are asking a question, ask it properly. We dont know about what you are working on as well as your entire codebase. 

What you choose to mention is the only info we have. 

Dont ask questions as if you are dropping a bomb in haste and expect someone to answer you. Provide as much detail as you want to solve your problem and very preferably give a link to the entire codebase or at least all relevant parts.

And do the basic things.. format your code, get rid of typos, etc etc..

Reply to: Hello everyone,

I'm using this example to create a token, but I'm still not sure how everything works. Could you please take a look at this transaction: https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQDm4O2WyFfctjA9LrrWje4NDp4gy21IhoMS5AuE9YoiTyAo? Why is the metadata empty? What needs to be done to fix this?

Also, am I creating the token correctly? Is this the standard?

Text: If I emitted a struct message in a contract, and I would like to know how to retrieve this message off-chain. I found this document ( https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/debug#logging-parsing ), but it doesn't explain how to retrieve the externals.body from the transaction.

for example, At the bottom of this page, there's an external-out message, which I suspect is the log emitted from my contract. How can I access this body through the client?

https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/762b50a6f6ddaec63d2b9592fc3b560bffb091c70ab1a2ad638461af5c886523

btw, the struct of message is 
message WalletManifestChangedEvent {
    oldManifestUrl: String;
    newManifestUrl: String;
}
----------------------------
I found the solution

get trace from https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/traces/<TX_ID>, 

curl -s https://testnet.tonapi.io/v2/traces/db96ca304b4126371b15db4ba4f64f8e7bcbffec8581c019abafc16b2eae9733 | jq '.children[-1].children[-1].transaction.out_msgs[-1].raw_body'

then 
const hexmsg = 'b5ee9c7201010201003c000208ae59284b0101006468747470733a2f2f6172696f2e6c6169736b792e636f6d2f616c6961732f6174746573742d6d616e69666573742e6a736f6e';

const cells = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(hexmsg, 'hex'));
const msg = loadWalletManifestChangedEvent(cells[0].asSlice());

console.log(`oldManifestUrl: ${msg.oldManifestUrl}`);
console.log(`newManifestUrl: ${msg.newManifestUrl}`);

                forward_payload: Cell.EMPTY.asSlice()
            }
        );

        expect(jettonNotifyWalletResponse.transactions).toHaveTransaction({

Text: from my experience, if you have a message that bounces for some reason, it will be easier to revert the changes if you have a smaller chain of transactions

e.g.

the chain: A -> B -> C -> D -> E

E bounces message, now D reverts changes and sends to C to revert changes, then C reverts and sends to B, etc.

if you have a chain like A -> E, then E bounces and A simply reverts changes

if you don't handle bounces, then it doesn't matter, but it's strongly recommended that you handle all bounces

Text: i haven't seen real-world applications for this case

your contract can sand a maximum of 255 actions per one contract call

if you have <= 255 actions (send_raw_message = 1 action)

then i would just loop over them and send all the messages in one transaction

if you have more transactions, then it may have sense to sort of recursively transfer transactions;

whats you case

Text: I'm working on a smart contract that involves verifying a signed message on-chain. The contract receives a message with several fields, including signature, data, and a few others. The contract first checks the validity of the signature before proceeding with any further logic.

I've implemented the off-chain message signing using ton-crypto and passed the signed message to the contract, but the signature verification fails on-chain. I'm not sure if I'm missing something in the signing process or if there's an issue with how the contract verifies the signature.

Could someone help me figure out what might be going wrong? I've provided the relevant parts of the code in this GitHub Gist. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

Text: Hello, if you don't mind, could you give me some advice? Let's say we have a pool from a platform like DeDust, and the pool has a method to get reserves, and I need to monitor changes in the reserves in real-time. Initially, I thought of doing it this way: subscribing to the transaction stream for the pool, and as soon as a new transaction comes in, calling the contract method. But I'm using RPC, and I don't have my own node. As a result, the request to get the reserves takes about 200ms. Is it possible to implement this faster, preferably in real-time?

        require(ctx.value >= self.min_fee, "Insufficient funds");
        require(self.county_tokens.get(msg.country) != null, "Country token not found");
        let country: Country = self.county_tokens.get(msg.country)!!;
        require(country.sellable, "Country token not sellable");
        let ton_amount: Int = (msg.amount * self.sell_rate * pow(10, 9)) / 100_000;
        dump(ton_amount);
        require(ton_amount > 0, "Invalid amount");

        send(SendParameters{
                to: country.address,
                value: ton("0.02"),
                mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
                body: SellTokenInternal{amount: msg.amount, seller: ctx.sender}.toCell()
            }
        );
        send(SendParameters{to: ctx.sender, value: ton_amount, bounce: true, mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors});

the function will burn the Tokens and then send the ton_amount to the sender

Text: In my smart contract on the TON blockchain, the protocol requires a user to complete two transactions for successful execution. To streamline the process, I've removed the need for the user to perform the second transaction themselves. Instead, during the first transaction, the user provides their signature, which allows an LP (Liquidity Provider) to execute the second transaction on their behalf.

I need to ensure that during the second transaction, I can verify that the provided signature indeed belongs to the user, using only the information available within the smart contract. Although one approach is to store the user's public key during the first transaction, I would prefer a more secure and efficient method, such as leveraging the TVM instruction ecrecover or other techniques to verify the signature's ownership without explicit key storage. What would be the best approach to achieve this?

Reply to: anyone encountered this bug when burning jetton? I tried burning 10 jetton with this code:

send(SendParameters{
                to: contractAddress(sellerWalletInit),
                value: 0,
                bounce: true,

            }
        );

on local unit test, the burned amount is exactly 10. but when deployed on testnet, the burn amount is 0.00000001

Should I call smart contracts from an endpoint, or is there a better approach to trigger the airdrop? Any guidance on how to set this up would be helpful. Thanks!

what exactly are you trying to solve using checkSignature? If you're checking the incoming message source - it's enough to compare addresses. If you're working with some external entities then you usually just store their public key in contract.

sha256(msg.item.toCell().asSlice())
 it returns the same hash for all incoming items (probably because it hashes only ref cell). So what is be the best approach of hasing a stuct with string fields (taking into account, that sha256 is relatively havy hash func and I can stand with lighter hashing)?

Text: But this guy says to store as uint256
Reply to: My solutions for Tact Challenge: https://github.com/aSpite/tact-challenge-contracts.

I added a README in which I described almost all the optimizations in order to make it convenient to read the code. There are also some points about inaccurate tests. 

The most interesting hacks:

- Storing the address as uint256 since Tact uses tact_verify_address every time an address is received, which consumes a lot of gas.

- Using commit (c4 and c5 saving) and throw(0) to abruptly exit the function when you only need to send a message without changing storage.

- The correct order of data storage in the storage. It is important to understand how Tact works with storage. It depends on which value will be the first on the stack. With the correct sequence of values used and their location in the storage, a significant improvement in gas can be achieved.

Text: üéâ Tact v1.5.0 has just been released

The new Tact release v1.5.0 just landed on NPM! Here are the highlights of the most important features.

üõ† New Tact features

asm functions allow you to access the deep dark corners of TVM for more features or better performance: 


asm fun keccak256(s: Slice): Int {
    1 INT HASHEXT_KECCAK256
}


asm functions have some limitations at this point and the Tact team will make them even more powerful in the next releases.

- A wider range of serialization options for integers can now be used, not just 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256-bit integers, but anything in between: uint1 through uint256 and int1 through int257. For instance, a 48-bit timestamp can be defined now if you'd like to build contracts that can work after the year 2038:


contract Contract {
    timestamp: Int as uint48
}


- Constant definitions now support calls to user-defined functions and references to other constants:


const CONSTANT: Int =
    myFunction(OTHER_CONSTANT)


üë©‚Äçüíª New builtin and stdlib functions and methods

- The exists method for the Map type: m.exists(key) which is equivalent to m.get(key) != null.

- The deepEquals method for the Map type: m1.deepEquals(m2) -- you can now easily compare two maps with the same key-value pairs and get true as the result, even if their internal representations are different, so the hash-based == comparison would return false.

- The toSlice method for structs and messages: struct.toSlice().

- The new slice, rawSlice, ascii and crc32 built-in compile-time functions to help you define constant integers and slices more conveniently.

- The new stdlib functions to help with fee calculations: gasConsumed, getComputeFee, getStorageFee, getForwardFee, getSimpleComputeFee, getSimpleForwardFee, getOriginalFwdFee, myStorageDue. This brings you access to the TVM instructions from 2023.07 and 2024.04 upgrades.

- The parseStdAddress and parseVarAddress stdlib functions allow you to parse slices into structured addresses.

üêû The new release also includes a bunch of bugfixes. Thanks to all the Tacticians for all the issues you open!

Text: Hello, talents. I need your help.

As I was deploying airdrop contract and trying to transfer method, I got an error. 

https://testnet.tonviewer.com/kQAx66S9GCN9e9iNeMBEng_vIw4UO0422khgfIvwJTt5sj8n

You can check contract here and there are failed transactions. 

Please help me urgently. 
Thanks

Text: Hello!
Can't find answer by search:
In tact by example forward_payload has Slice type(as remaining)
But in docs on official site it has Cell type.
What option is correct?

We have both variants in mainnet (from two different teams) and i need to communicate with both. Should i separate them, or it's fine to pass argument with cell type (in tests Slice version accept Cell, but not vice versa).
P.S. in theory we can redeploy Slice version if nothing wrong with Cell and it's be better for future interactions.

Text: Theoretically possible but doing so would circumvent the scaling features of TON, and if your account chain's state becomes very large by way of many many entries to this mapping, the rent would be quite high. Sharding the state is a superpower, not a limitation.

There are other examples available, some of them could be found on GitHub. Just extend this search with code patterns you are interested in: https://github.com/search?q=path%3A*.tact&type=code.
Reply to: Are there some good examples available for common stuff like, transferring Jetton from user to contract, contract to contract, interacting with other contracts, etc?

Text: See the main page: https://tact-lang.org/

tl;dr: Tact is a safer, more high-level alternative that won't let you shoot yourself in the foot with error-prone low-level stuff. But in some projects you'll need to write some logic in FunC and integrate it to Tact in order to optimize things or involve low-level constructions.
Reply to: helloÔºå I would like to ask if there is a significant difference in functionality between Tact language and FunC language. I am accustomed to using typescript language in my daily life. Which language should I learn for developing TON

Text: hey guys, quick question:

Lets say i wanted to implement something similar to https://tact-by-example.org/06-unbounded-arrays


A todo list is pretty simple, but lets say i want to offer this to several users. In that case, what are some ideas to implement a basic auth here, as it would defeat its purpose if anyone could go and interact with the parent contract, modifying other users todo list.

From: Jiego
Text: something like:

1) user creates a list, on the parent contract i store their address and the id on a map
2) on a third contract i want to check the state of the child-todo, so i would need to use the parent-todo to access the auth info and deny access to the user if its not the owner
3) the parent-todo could get clogged if billions of users got in

Text: I think your question is very strange. If you want to transfer jetton/NFT, then you must know the contract code, and therefore, initof must be able to get the correct address.

BTW, even if the target contract doesn't exist, the message can still be delivered, unless you set bounce: true.
Reply to: cool, but i meant when you create a StateInit with some information that maybe doesnt match the reality (an edge case). is there a way for me to know if the contract actually exists?

Text: it makes things harder
in case of some limited set of jettons, I‚Äôd sugget you to store the map from jetton master address to jetton wallet address in your contract

then you need to accept the jetton wallet address (or cell with code) as an input in your tact contract to calculate jetton wallet address from it
in general it‚Äôs impossible to calculate jetton master -> jetton wallet address mapping since different jettons may have different code

where jetton master has provide_wallet_address method to return (asynchonously, of course) the jetton wallet address

but not every jetton is a discoverable jetton, so you can‚Äôt rely on it

From: Dmitriy Mozhevitin
Text: so you either need to rework your contract to support only some whitelisted set of jettons or accept jetton wallet address (or code) as an argument
but for the latter case you also need to come up with some validation to make sure that jetton wallet address indeed corresponds to a certain jetton master

Text: Hello, I am dealing with an async problem here. 
I am trying to create infinite maps, and a solution proposed is to deploy a new mapping on an empty contract that holds that value such as jetton does. Every time I execute a function in my c ontract, the a new value is inserted in the mapping, and each value is related to each other like a chain. And I need to also query the new contract. My problem comes when that call might fail, and I need to revert changes. I tried putting a bounced method but it is not easy to revert a hashchain  in the mapping, moreover when I might have many calls at the same time.

Can you recommend something to read or watch regarding gas payments in contracts on TON?

Right now, I don't understand who pays the gas and when.
We keep the balance non-zero, and I understand why. However, I'm unsure how the gas is deducted from contracts that have used up their entire balance.
And how do you control all of this when writing contracts in Tact?

Thanks!

Whoever starts the transaction covers all the fees
Reply to: Hello guys,
Can you recommend something to read or watch regarding gas payments in contracts on TON?

Right now, I don't understand who pays the gas and when.
We keep the balance non-zero, and I understand why. However, I'm unsure how the gas is deducted from contracts that have used up their entire balance.
And how do you control all of this when writing contracts in Tact?

Thanks!

Text: hello everyone,  i currently follow this tutorial in youtube:
https://youtu.be/EaoVJuSCVmU?si=akQAE-XLTm3OgOmt

When i try to run the test, i got this error:
" Unable to execute get method. Got exit_code: 11

      27 |
      28 |     async getData(provider: ContractProvider){
    > 29 |         const {stack} = await provider.get("get_the_latest_sender",[]);
         |                         ^
      30 |         return {
      31 |             recent_sender: stack.readAddress(),
      32 |         }
"

Here is the function in contract:
slice get_the_latest_sender() method_id {
    ;; get memory cell from C4 storage
    slice ds = get_data().begin_parse();
    return ds~load_msg_sender();
}

The wrapper:
import { Contract, Address, Cell, beginCell, contractAddress, ContractProvider, Sender, SendMode } from "ton-core"

export class MainContract implements Contract {
    constructor(readonly address: Address, readonly init?: { code: Cell, data: Cell }) {
        
    }

    // create contract instance base on config
    static createFromConfig(config:any, code:Cell, workchain = 0){
        const data = beginCell().endCell();
        const init = { code, data };
        const address = contractAddress(workchain, init);
        return new MainContract(address, init);
    }

    async sendInternalMessage(
        provider: ContractProvider,
        sender: Sender,
        value: bigint,
    ){
        await provider.internal(sender, {
            value, 
            sendMode: SendMode.PAY_GAS_SEPARATELY,
            body: beginCell().endCell()
        })
    }

    async getData(provider: ContractProvider){
        const {stack} = await provider.get("get_the_latest_sender",[]);
        return {
            recent_sender: stack.readAddress(),
        }
    }
}
and the test
import { Cell, Address, toNano } from "ton-core"
import { hex } from "../build/main.compiled.json"
import { Blockchain } from "@ton-community/sandbox"
import { MainContract } from "../wrappers/MainContract"

import "@ton-community/test-utils"

describe("main.fc contracts tests", () => {
    it("our first test", async () => {
        const codeCell = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(hex, "hex"))[0];

        const blockchain = await Blockchain.create();

        const myContract = blockchain.openContract(
            await MainContract.createFromConfig({}, codeCell)
        );

        const senderWallet = await blockchain.treasury("sender");

        const sendMessageResult = await myContract.sendInternalMessage(senderWallet.getSender(), toNano("0.05")) // 50 000 000 

        // toHaveTransaction is a custom matcher come from @ton-community/test-utils
        expect(sendMessageResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: senderWallet.address,
            to: myContract.address,
            success: true,
        })
        
        const data = await myContract.getData();

        expect(data.recent_sender.toString()).toBe(senderWallet.address.toString());
    })
})

Can anyone please explain the error and help me fix that, thanks a lot !

Text: Hello everyone, for several days now I can't figure out how to generate the correct payload for my smart contract. I will be very grateful if someone can help üôè

There is a smart contract on the clock for accepting payments:

------------

import "@stdlib/deploy";

message Payment {
    orderId: Int as uint32;
}

message PaymentReceived {
    orderId: Int as uint32;
    amount: Int as coins;
    sender: Address;
}

contract PaymentReceiver with Deployable {
    owner: Address;
    
    init(owner: Address) {
        self.owner = owner;
    }

    receive(msg: Payment) {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        
        // Check that the transfer amount is greater than 0
        require(ctx.value > 0, "Payment amount must be greater than 0");
        
        // We will issue an event about the received payment
        emit(PaymentReceived{
            orderId: msg.orderId,
            amount: ctx.value,
            sender: ctx.sender
        }.toCell());

        // We send funds to the owner of the contract
        send(SendParameters{
            to: self.owner,
            value: ctx.value - ton("0.1"), // We leave a little for the commission
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
            bounce: false
        });
    }

    // Handler for the "withdraw" text message, allowing the owner to withdraw funds
    receive("withdraw") {
        let ctx: Context = context();
        require(ctx.sender == self.owner, "Only the owner can withdraw");
        
        send(SendParameters{
            to: self.owner,
            value: myBalance() - ton("0.1"), // We leave a little for the commission
            mode: SendIgnoreErrors,
            bounce: false
        });
    }

    get fun owner(): Address {
        return self.owner;
    }
}

------------

at the front, I am forming a transaction and trying to form the correct body for the payload

------------

import type { SendTransactionRequest, SendTransactionResponse } from '@tonconnect/sdk'
import { TonConnectButton, useTonAddress, useTonWallet, useTonConnectUI } from '@townsquarelabs/ui-vue'
import { beginCell, Address, toNano } from "@ton/core";
import { storePayment, Payment } from ' ./tact_PaymentReceiver'; // Importing the necessary functions from the generated file

...

const { order_id, amount, payment_address } = paymentInfo.value

const payment: Payment = {
  $$type: 'Payment',
  orderId: BigInt(order_id)
};

const testAmount = 0.05 //test amount

const body = beginCell()
    .store(storePayment(payment))
    .endCell();


// Forming
a const transaction = {
  validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 600, // Transaction duration (10 minutes)
  messages: [
{
address: payment_address, // Contract address
      amount: toNano(testAmount.toString()).toString(), // Payment amount
      stateInit: undefined,
      payload: body.toBoc().toString('base64'),
    }
  ]
};

paymentStatus.value = 'sending'
const result: SendTransactionResponse = await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction(transaction)

------------

as soon as I didn't try to generate a correct payload, an error occurs every time 'it is not possible to verify the transaction'

But if you comment out the payload: body.toBoc().toString('base64') line, then the transaction is created and confirmed in the wallet successfully

Text: Guys, hello. 
Could you please help me? 
I'm building a payload to send jetton like this: 

transferPayload := cell.BeginCell().
 MustStoreUInt(sendJettonOpCode, 32).
 MustStoreUInt(uint64(messageID), 64).
 MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromDecimal(fmt.Sprintf("%f", amount), jettonData.Decimals).Nano()).
 MustStoreAddr(h.contractAddress).
 MustStoreAddr(parsedSenderAddress).
 MustStoreBoolBit(false).
 MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromTON("0.05").Nano()).
 MustStoreBuilder(forwardPayload).
 EndCell()


also I calculate jettonAddress of the sender this way:


token := jetton.NewJettonMasterClient(api, address.MustParseAddr(jettonData.MasterContract))

senderTokenWallet, err := token.GetJettonWallet(ctx, parsedSenderAddress)
if err != nil {
 h.log.Error().Err(err).Msg("failed to get wallet for sender")

 return "", "", err
}


but when I'm trying to send such transaction i see this. 

if i send such transcation i will get 49 exit code. I couldn't find any info about this code. 

but the most interesting part - the same code works perfectly in testnet. 

maybe someone can help me?

Text: it shows in Failed because you calculated in wrong Jetton Wallet Address sir.
Reply to: Guys, hello. 
Could you please help me? 
I'm building a payload to send jetton like this: 

transferPayload := cell.BeginCell().
 MustStoreUInt(sendJettonOpCode, 32).
 MustStoreUInt(uint64(messageID), 64).
 MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromDecimal(fmt.Sprintf("%f", amount), jettonData.Decimals).Nano()).
 MustStoreAddr(h.contractAddress).
 MustStoreAddr(parsedSenderAddress).
 MustStoreBoolBit(false).
 MustStoreBigCoins(tlb.MustFromTON("0.05").Nano()).
 MustStoreBuilder(forwardPayload).
 EndCell()


also I calculate jettonAddress of the sender this way:


token := jetton.NewJettonMasterClient(api, address.MustParseAddr(jettonData.MasterContract))

senderTokenWallet, err := token.GetJettonWallet(ctx, parsedSenderAddress)
if err != nil {
 h.log.Error().Err(err).Msg("failed to get wallet for sender")

 return "", "", err
}


but when I'm trying to send such transaction i see this. 

if i send such transcation i will get 49 exit code. I couldn't find any info about this code. 

but the most interesting part - the same code works perfectly in testnet.

but that was not the case. 
I don't know why exactly, but if I add one zero uint before the forward payload slice - it is working properly. But i also needed to read that uint in smart contract. 
And as I said before - have no idea why it was working in testnet

Self.reply and sending balance in sendRemainingValue mode in transactions only send the TON amount that is remaining from the transaction Fees is what I read.

But when I use them in my contract, a little amount of TON from my contract is getting deducted. So at some point will my contract be depleted of all TON.

Text: I came across this contract again while testing Misti. The latest 0.4 version shows 19 warnings, including duplicated code and incorrect behavior of some standard library functions, which may lead to issues in the frontend's functionality.
Reply to: Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out today to seek feedback on a smart contract I've been working on. It's Nft contracts which allows only whitelisted users mint NFTs. it is managed by a WhitelistManager on which owners add users to whitelist it deploy new contract that stores users whitelist info. That contract can be call by the whitelist user. User call "mintNFT" to mint nft from two contracts Cards and Pets

I've posted the code on GitHub Gist: https://gist.github.com/nxved/217b473ba275ddfe582b4ad0a225ea01

I'm particularly interested in getting your insights on:

Security: Are there any potential vulnerabilities or exploits in the contract?
Functionality: Does the code achieve the intended functionality as expected?
Efficiency: Can the code be optimized for better gas usage or performance?
Best Practices: Are there any coding practices or standards I should be following that I've missed?
Any feedback or suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated. I'm open to learning and improving the contract, so please don't hesitate to point out any areas that could be better.

Text: Hi guys, need some help, I am trying to calculate my contract Jetton wallet inside the contract
struct JettonWalletData {

fun calculateJettonWalletAddress(ownerAddress: Address, jettonMasterAddress: Address, jettonWalletCode: Cell): Address {
    let initData = JettonWalletData{ownerAddress, jettonMasterAddress};
    return contractAddress(StateInit{code: jettonWalletCode, data: initData.toCell()});

As Jetton I use example from ton-dynasty

function from JettonWallet - 
override inline fun calculate_jetton_wallet_init(owner_address: Address): StateInit {
        return initOf ExampleJettonWallet(owner_address, self.jetton_master);

Jetton Master function -
get fun get_wallet_address(owner_address: Address): Address {
        let initCode: StateInit = self.calculate_jetton_wallet_init(owner_address);
        return contractAddress(initCode);
    }

Yet in my tests I get two diffrent wallets, I am loosing my mind
 let masterPredictedWallet = await jettonMaster.getGetWalletAddress(MyCoolContract.address)

        console.log(await MyCoolContract.getJettonWallet()) // EQCEMrJerbRirCbXmbDXNik03AmvErXe5_yYR9ZINwNHWFFS
        console.log(masterPredictedWallet) // EQAS3hnn6C1KeNNn3ehx90iOqqMAEGaPs6xbNaCRwMtAro3Q

Jetton Master function -
get fun get_wallet_address(owner_address: Address): Address {
        let initCode: StateInit = self.calculate_jetton_wallet_init(owner_address);
        return contractAddress(initCode);
    }

Yet in my tests I get two diffrent wallets, I am loosing my mind
 let masterPredictedWallet = await jettonMaster.getGetWalletAddress(MyCoolContract.address)

        console.log(await MyCoolContract.getJettonWallet()) // EQCEMrJerbRirCbXmbDXNik03AmvErXe5_yYR9ZINwNHWFFS
        console.log(masterPredictedWallet) // EQAS3hnn6C1KeNNn3ehx90iOqqMAEGaPs6xbNaCRwMtAro3Q

Any Ideas what went wrong?

UPD, jettonWalletCode are same, so I am just stuck

Text: Hello everyone!
My name is Sergey, and I‚Äôm with the DeFi Canvas project. We participated in the TON Bootcamp from October 11-13, and now we are #lookingfor reinforcements.

We are preparing a DeFi product for TON Hackers, aiming to release an MVP by the end of November. Currently, we are looking for:

- Frontend Developer: Experienced in TWA, React, and API integrations. Knowledge of TON is a plus.
FunC/Tact Developer: Knowledge of TWA, swap functions, and liquidity interactions.

We already have a concept, mockups, a testnet solution, and a working backend. Now, we are finalizing the scope, prioritizing features, and distributing tasks. As a startup, we are budget-conscious and primarily focused on earning rewards from TON Hackers winter. However, we have a small budget to cover operational expenses for the next month.

If you're interested or know someone who might be, feel free to DM me for more details. Thanks, everyone! :)

P.S. Most of our team members are ru-speaking

Text: Hello guys is there any limitation on computation size or memory in the execution of a function? I am running an iteration and dumping the value of the iterator and breaks early. I tried sending more gas but it ends in the same point . Running through a get reaches further but it cuts due to gas limitations. And putting inside the receive breaks in that point,  and adding more dumps, makes it break even earlier.
Also testing that piece of code alone works fine. The problem is when adding it inside of a bigger func.

I'm generating a hash using '.hash()' on a Cell object

Reply to: See the main page: https://tact-lang.org/

tl;dr: Tact is a safer, more high-level alternative that won't let you shoot yourself in the foot with error-prone low-level stuff. But in some projects you'll need to write some logic in FunC and integrate it to Tact in order to optimize things or involve low-level constructions.

Text: The problem is not really in storing balances, but in the ability to liquidate loans when the price changes, given that our parent contract determines the price of the asset. So, when the parent (a uniswap v2-like pool) contract understands that the price reaches a certain point, it may want to liquidate some loans. 

The only way I see is offchain tracking with incentives for liquidators

Reply to: How to get the HASHEXT_SHA256 TVM opcode working in Tact? 

I want to get a function in Tact with a signature like HASHEXT_SHA256(hash0: Slice, hash1: Slice) -> Slice?

Having another function which accepts builders would be highly appreciated as well

Is there some kind of notification I can receive in my contract to be aware of this and make state changes accordingly?

projects: map<Int as uint64, Int as coins>;


but in a generated FunC code value is treated like a default int257


__tact_dict_get_uint_int($self'projects, 64, $projectId, 257);
$self'projects~__tact_dict_set_uint_int(64, $msg'projectId, $msg'rate, 257)


hovewer in a generated ts file it is way different:


b_0.storeDict(src.projects, Dictionary.Keys.BigUint(64), Dictionary.Values.BigUint(124));


seems line value size does not work in FunC and wrong on ts side (should be Dictionary.Values.BigVarUint(16) as i remember)

Text: I wonder how fragment selling usernames.
For example, I connected my wallet ton to my username, it's stored on their server not in smart contract.
When someone bids and win they transfer funds to my wallet, however they get this wallet from their server, which can be hacked or replaced by them.
How this things consider to be safe or where it is stored, maybe I understand it wrong.

Now the logic is:
1) Received seqno BEFORE
2) Sent the transaction
3) Waited for seqno to change
4) Called the list of last transactions via the toncenter and took the last one

The doc says let transfer = await userWallet.sendTransfer(...)
BUT transfer is an empty void

P.S.

import { TonClient, WalletContractV4 } from '@ton/ton';
    let wallet = WalletContractV4.create({ workchain, publicKey: keyPair.publicKey });
    let userWallet = tonClient.open(wallet);

Text: Hi everyone.
I am new in TON ecosystem.
Right now I starting with Tact language.

I understand, that concept of Tact and TON ecosystem is not the similar with EVM, it is clear.
Could somebody guide me  (or give an example) how to implement the following scenario in Tact.

Scneario in EVM (solidity)
Contract USDTReceiver
- contract accept payments in USDT from various users.
- contract tracks the total amount of payments from any user.
- control allows to withdraw all usdt by the admin (doesn't matter why)

From the tech part, the user must call the method ERC20.approve({USDTReceiver}, {mount}).
And then contract USDTReceiver is able to call the method ERC20.sendTransferFrom() to charge/transfer usdt from the user to contract.

How to do the same in Tact?
Not sure, Jetton template has similar concept like approve and sendTransferFrom.
Apparently another approach is used to accept USDT Jetton (or any other external jetton) inside Tact smart contract methods.

Please help to figure out with TON and Tact code.

Text: Hi all, please help me with a problem, I have a contract to which the user transfers Jetton, the situation is like this, Jetton is transferred in three stages:
1. the first transaction is the user calls the tokenTransfer method of his Jetton wallet, where he passes the necessary data, such as the address of the recipient, the number of tokens to be transferred, etc.
2. the second transaction is tokenTransfer sends the tokenTransferInternal message to the recipient's wallet.
3. the third transaction is sending a tokenNotification message to the owner's address from the Jetton wallet contract.
my contract has a method that processes the tokenNotification message and in case something goes wrong, it should rollback the transaction. But the problem is that it can only roll back the transaction with tokenNotification message, but the token transfer itself (which was in transaction 2) cannot be rolled back, how can I solve this problem?

Text: Hi guysüë©‚Äçüíª, we want to make a contract with a deposit method for jetton tokens(as well as TON). As we assume, the deposit method should be sub-called inside the jetton transfer call. 

But when we revert the deposit method (after logical checks) it doesn't revert the transfer. It's very different from traditional Smart Contracts from other chains. 

How to implement this flow. Can you suggest any project to look after. Can you suggest any workaround for that?

Text: Hi :), sorry if I keep coming back to this, but it is unclear to me.  In this tutorial, for USDT, we have: struct JettonWalletData {
    status: Int as uint4;
    balance: Int as coins;
    ownerAddress: Address;
    jettonMasterAddress: Address;
}

// And the function to calculate the wallet address may look like this:
fun calculateJettonWalletAddress(
    ownerAddress: Address,
    jettonMasterAddress: Address,
    jettonWalletCode: Cell
): Address {

    let initData = JettonWalletData{
        status: 0,
        balance: 0,
        ownerAddress,
        jettonMasterAddress,
    };

    return contractAddress(StateInit{
        code: jettonWalletCode,
        data: initData.toCell(),
    });
}.  My questions are: 1.  All of the JettonWallet implementations I saw take in as constructor input parameters the owner address and the master contract address.  Should the USDT wallet take in as input the JettonWalletData struct? or should it take 4 paramters: status, balance, ownerAddress, jettonMasterAddress? 2. type 'uint4' does not exist in Tact, how should I define the status parameter then? Is there a way to limit integers in tact to the range of [0,15].  3. What is this status parameter? Should I store it as a state variable in the wallet implementation? Any help on this would be much much appreciated üôè .  If anyone has an example of a USDT wallet in tact and doesn't mind sharing it - also much appreciated.  Thanks in advance

Text: This question is not related to the Tact language, but there are few examples of jetton multisenders and misunderstandings arise.

I already have a jetton and jetton wallet contract.
I'm trying to implement a multisender contract, nothing complicated just receiving the recipients and jetton amount in msg then transfer in a loop. So my multisender can't store the jettons by itself (obviously), only on the jetton wallet instance that was created for him automatically (as I can understand), obviously I have to run the multisend function with "multisenderJettonWallet.send ... { $$type: 'MultiSend' ...}," but it can't accept this message because the jetton wallet contract itself can't receive this type of message.

So the question arises whether it would be a good practice to implement the multisend logic directly in the main jetton wallet contract and remove the multisender contract altogether or are there any other approaches to implementation?

Text: If you have the pool identifier yes you can query it from another contract, however because it would be N asynchronous queries to the N pools being queried the pool states you‚Äôre comparing cannot be considered equivalent. It is entirely possible for another mutation to occur prior to your contract being able to act upon the information. 

For example, if you query NOT-USDT then query TON-USDT, compare the values and determine NOT is a better opportunity (or whatever), there‚Äôs no guarantee that the state will be the same as observed for either pool by the time you perform a swap.

let bridge: SandboxContract<Bridge>;

deployer = await blockchain.treasury("deployer");

bridge = blockchain.openContract(
      await Bridge.fromInit(deployer.address, deployer.address, pub_key)
);

Next I want to make Mint tokens to some address:
const deployTokenResult = await fungibleToken.send(
  deployer.getSender(),
  {
    value: toNano("0.05"),
  },
  {
    $$type: "Mint",
    amount: supply,
    receiver: bridge.address,
  }
);

The point is that the owner of the token is bridge, not deployer, so I need to send this transaction from bridge, because in the mint function there is a check on the owner, but I can not use getSender method for bridge, only for deployer, how to solve this?

Text: Thanks, but I don‚Äôt really understand this code 

I had two ideas:

1. Simply add require(context().value >= ton(‚Äú0.25‚Äù)) and in the end of the function do self.forward to send the excess TONs back

2. Change the value of the minting transaction from ton(‚Äú0.1‚Äù) into context().value / 2 - ton(‚Äú0.05‚Äù) 

But none of them seem elegant. If we only had one jetton minting call, I could use the flag SendRemainingValue, but since I have two similar calls, I‚Äôm not sure how to do that properly

Text: If a transaction includes multiple sends and you wish to have precise control over the value, you might need to follow the implementation I provided. This ensures that you can control each send's value accurately, while also confirming that the ctx.value is enough to cover all sends. Additionally, use nativeReserve to protect the contract's balance, and refund any remaining ctx.value.

For the same reason that you cannot use SendRemainingValue, I think that you also cannot use self.forward.

        let unlock_time: Int = 1735454400;
        
        // Check if sender is not owner and current time is before unlock date
        if ((ctx.sender != self.owner) && (current_time < unlock_time)) {
            throw(132);
        }

        require(self.mintable, "Can't Mint Anymore");
        self.mint(ctx.sender, msg.amount, self.owner);
    }
}

But it's not working, user getting Insufficient balance when sending after that time, any one could help ?

If messages in your contract are processed idempotently (i.e. multiple received messages all yield same results as the first received message), then you won't need this queryId

The function above works by calculating and storing digits of the soon-to-be hex number in a map going right to left by the number, and then composing the actual number by going in reverse, since foreach obtains entries in ascending order of key values.

Reply to: Something like this would work, but at this point it is probably best to move some of this logic off chain:

```tact
fun hex(x: Int): String {

Text: Perhaps someone can point me in the right direction. I'm transferring Jettons w/ comments and I need to process the comment inside a contract (via jettonNotify message). Think of this like a metadata check: if metadata OK do something, if not send jettons back/do something else. The "metadata" should hold a few pieces of information, so I'm inclined to pass a map into to jetton transfer comment and somehow parse that in the contract.

Text: Hey!
Looking for an advise.
I'm developing a smart contract. Basically upon the call to the smart contract, object should be initiated, then upon other calls, it get's modified, and eventually distributes the funds.
After that I don't really need the object anymore.

So, my question is, what is the best design approach here?
Should I create 1 smart contract, deploy it, and store/clear objects 
Or should I rather deploy a new instance of smart contract upon every object creation (not even sure yet if it's possible though)?

Thanks

We are starting to work on our new optimizing compiler backend, so no transpilation into FunC or Tolk won‚Äôt be needed. We estimate its arrival in Q1 or Q2 2025
Reply to: The language looks great with excellent documentation, but it seems like Func is deprecated now and Tolk is coming. Will Tact also be compiled into Tolk?

Text: Hi guys. I know that my question is somewhat irrelevant to this group and it's a reactjs question. But I want to interact with my smart contract from a react app. I have deployed a simple smart contract named "Counter". It has a simple method getCounter that returns the current value of the counter. I know how to send Increment request to increase the counter value but don't know how to read it. Can somebody help?

My reactjs code:
import { beginCell, toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { TonConnectButton, useTonConnectUI } from '@tonconnect/ui-react';
import { storeIncrement } from './contracts/counter';
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESS } from './constants';

const App = () => {
  const [tonConnectUI] = useTonConnectUI();

  const transaction = {
    validUntil: Date.now() / 1000 + 60,
    messages: [
      {
        address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        amount: toNano('0.01').toString(),
        payload: beginCell()
          .store(
            storeIncrement({
              $$type: 'Increment',
              amount: 1n,
            })
          )
          .endCell()
          .toBoc()
          .toString('base64'),
      },
    ],
  };

  const handleIncrement = async () => {
    const result = await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction(transaction);

    console.log('Result: ', result);
  };

  const handleGetCounter = async () => {
    // TODO: Get counter from Counter smart contract
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <TonConnectButton />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Send Increment</button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleGetCounter}>Get Counter</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

My Tact code:
import "@stdlib/deploy";

message Increment {
    amount: Int as uint32
}

contract Counter with Deployable {
    // Empty init() function is present by default in all Tact contracts
    // since v1.3.0, so the following may be omitted:
    //

    counter: Int as uint32;
    id: Int as uint32;

    init(id: Int) {
        self.counter = 0;
        self.id = id;
    }

    receive("increment") {
        self.counter += 1;
    }

    receive(msg: Increment) {
        self.counter += msg.amount;
    }

    receive() {
        
    }

    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }
}

Reply to: Hi all, can you please advise me how to send Jettons from SC. For example, I have a SC that needs to receive Jetton and then when receiving a message send them to other wallets. How can I use the send method to do this?

Text: ‚ö°Ô∏è Completely overhauled exit codes page in the documentation

Sometimes pages in the Tact documentation are more detailed than you'll find elsewhere. The exit codes page is a case in point.

Not only do you get a comprehensive description of what exit codes are, how they are defined, and which ones are reserved, but you also get a handy table of them with short descriptions and quick navigation to each exit code in the table of contents. Since each of the exit codes has its own headings, linking to a specific exit code is easier than ever!

In addition, all descriptions of compute phase exit codes show examples of how you might encounter them. And sometimes even help you to anticipate and avoid them.

By the way, for exit code 50 (not listed anywhere else), we've also described the current limits on config param 43 related to account state, max number of bits and cells in messages, and much more.

                // For more complicated transfers, adjust accordingly

What is forwardPayload? Is it some additional payload sent as a notification to a destination?

Text: Best approach of interacting with Jettons can be seen here https://docs.dedust.io/recipes . User transfer jettons to a Vault and then Jettons are processed without actually sending them
Reply to: Is there something like approve for jettons?

I have a DEX contract. 
A user interacts with that contract. 

During that interaction I would like to transfer user's jettons (from user's jetton wallet) to the escrow (to the jetton wallet of my DEX contract). Suppose I know jetton master's address.

Text: No. JettonNotify in unbounceable and user will lose the tokens. But nevermind, it's only his responsibility to attach enough tons (If the user builds message manually). If you are building a message for him and sending it using TonConnect, you should correctly estimate fee, and return excesses.

Text: https://docs.tact-lang.org/cookbook/jettons/#accepting-jetton-transfer

Why doesn't jetton wallet contain a receive("get_wallet_data"). This way we would be able to check the sender by extracting the code and master from the received wallet data. Of course we must trust the jetton.

I want to accept (in theory) any jetton transfers to the Vault but I must check the sender of the JettonTransferNotification is the Vault's jetton wallet every time. I don't really want to have a whitelist of supported jettons.

But jettons may have different precision, right?

Text: Maybe you could anwser this questions?
I found a diagram with token transfer flow. Seems that user or contract might have two wallet addresses - wallet and jetton wallet. So how can i get jetton addrees from contract? Is this jetton wallet should be initialized on the deploy? For me these topics is not very clear since i'm coming not from funC and blockchain. Lets say i have a simple contract witch main responsible is to distribute incoming jettons (usdt) to two wallet (let say contract owner and orginizer). How to communicate with such contract from the frontend (user wallet)?

Can somebody help me with handling asm functions in Tact?
I am not sure if I'm doing sha512 right inside my contract:

asm fun sha512( s: Builder ): Slice
{
    ONE HASHEXT_SHA512
}

asm fun sha512Two( s1: Builder, s2: Builder ): Slice
{
    TWO HASHEXT_SHA512
}

Should it return Slice? Or Cell? Or smth else?
I know that it returns two 256 bit integers from TVM but I don't see any explanation on how to handle such data with Tact (I know that we can do it in func).

Thanks!

Text: If you just want an on-chain hash that'll produce correct results (same as H-strings in FunC) for Builders/Slices (viewed as Strings) with any number of bytes allowed within account limits, then refer to this comment (soon to be in the docs).

Now, in general, whenever you expect multiple return values (tensor or tuple return types OR multiple stack values), then you have to provide a Struct to capture those. For example, it can look something like this:

struct Sha512 { h1: Int; h2: Int }
asm fun sha512(s: Slice): Sha512 { ONE HASHEXT_SHA512 UNPAIR }
asm fun twoSha512(s1: Slice, s2: Slice): Sha512 { TWO HASHEXT_SHA512 UNPAIR }
Btw, there is HASHEXTA_SHA512, which would also append the result to the provided Builder and return the new Builder. That is, no extra Structs for mapping needed :)

I find approval functionality like on Solana SPL tokens or Ethereum ERC20 tokens safer than Jetton Notifications solution, where the token transfer transaction is not reverted (bounced) even if the notification is reverted (bounced).

Also the jetton standard does not has decimals field to rely on the token precision on chain.

Text: Hi guys, how to calculate op_codes in tact? 
According to docs we should use CRC32 from TL-B Schema https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/crc32

but according to tact's docs we should use type signatures instead of tlb https://github.com/tact-lang/tact/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L935
i.e. I've got TLB and Signature from .md project file after tact building 
TLB: check_in#722bfa86 chatId:int257 = CheckIn
Signature: CheckIn{chatId:int257}

I've tried to get crc32 from signature and got 
crc32("CheckIn{chatId:int257}") = 0x7ec9b591
I've tried to use & 0x7FFFFFFF according to the 1st url and got 0xfec9b591

Reply to: Trading, do you mean ‚Äúswap‚Äù or ‚Äúsell‚Äù?
From what you texted in following text, I conclude you mean swap.

The best way to follow the documentation of DEX(dedust and ston.fi) where you plan to manage swap.

Text: Hey. Thank you for the idea.
I am experiencing some issues implementing it:

Suppose src jetton and dst jetton are of the same precision of 9 decimals.

Remind dst jetton amount = src jetton amount * exchange rate

Suppose I want to set exchange rate to 0.5 [dst/src]. I want 1 src token to be worth 0.5 dst tokens.

Since we can't work with decimal numbers, we must represent exchange rate with some precision based on both src and dst jetton decimals.

Let's set exchange rate to be 0.5 * 10^9 (9 decimals). Then:
dst jetton amount = (src jetton amount * exchange rate) / 10^9

We must also divide src jetton amount * exchange rate by the "common" decimals for src jetton amount and exchange rate.

I am not sure if this value we divide by can be set as some constant and we may provide only exchange rate...

Text: I have 2 questions. 

Context: 

Tact_code
import { beginCell, Cell, contractAddress, StateInit, storeStateInit } from '@ton/core';

const [tonConnectUI] = useTonConnectUI();

const init = {
    code: Cell.fromBase64('<CONTRACT_CODE>'),
    data: Cell.fromBase64('<CONTRACT_INIT_DATA>')
} satisfies StateInit;

const stateInit = beginCell()
    .store(storeStateInit(init))
    .endCell();

const address = contractAddress(0, init);

await tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({
    validUntil: Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    messages: [
        {
            address: address.toRawString(),
            amount: '5000000',
            stateInit: stateInit.toBoc().toString('base64')
        }
    ]
});

This code is the standard for the deployment of a contract via a tonconnect. 

1 question - what should I put in contract_code? I have an import of @stdlib/deploy in my code. Is it easy to insert it along with the rest of the code on the clock in this place? 

2 question - what exactly and how to insert into contract_init_data? What is in the code under the word init? Or without that word? Can you show me an example, please?

As I understand it, the tact does not document how exactly the contract input data should be formed, so you need to look at the auto-gen wrappers. But that's the problem. I need to deploy the contract at the time of sending the transaction

Text: Hey folks! üëã
I'm working with a TactCounter smart contract (code below), and I need some help crafting a working example to call the MyAdd method using sendTransaction via TON Connect.

The contract looks like this:


import "@stdlib/deploy";

message MyAdd {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

contract TactCounter with Deployable {
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;

    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id;
        self.counter = 0;
    }

    receive(msg: MyAdd) {
        self.counter += msg.amount;
    }

    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id;
    }
}

Here's an example of a basic transaction with a comment:

const body = beginCell()
  .storeUint(0, 32)
  .storeStringTail("Hello, TON!")
  .endCell();

await connector.sendTransaction({
  validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 360,
  messages: [
    {
      address: destination,
      amount: toNano("0.05").toString(),
      payload: body.toBoc().toString("base64")
    }
  ]
});

I need to adapt this approach to send the MyAdd message, filling in queryId and amount fields properly. Can anyone help with the payload construction? üôè

Thanks in advance! üòä

btw, please notice that the full Fift support is subject to change in the future Tact versions, so WHILE:<{ ‚Ä¶  and many other high-level control flow structures most likely won‚Äôt be available

Text: Hi, as I know stars can subsequently be converted via Fragment and receive a Ton in return. As I understand this method bypassed the problems associated with implementing payment methods in the app. Thereby minimising the problems with regulators on the outside. As I understand it, Telegram circumvents this by the fact that stars are just an in-app purchase, like in-game purchases in games. All in all, something like that, if I'm wrong, feel free to correct me)
